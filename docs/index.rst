DefectDojo's Documentation
==========================

.. image:: /_static/dashboard.png

`DefectDojo` is a tool created by the Security Engineering team at Rackspace to track testing efforts. It attempts to
streamline the testing process by offering features such as templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline
self-service tools. Though it was designed with security folks in mind, there is nothing keeping QA/QE testers, or any
other testers for that matter, from using it productively.

The code is open source, and `available on github`_.

A demo installation can be `found over at PythonAnywhere`_.
