The essence of DefectDojo is to import security data, organize it, and present it to the folks who need to know.  Here's a quick reference you can use to ensure successful implementation, from a blank canvas to a fully functional app.

### Discover DefectDojo

1. Start by [importing a file](/import_data/import_scan_files/pro__import_scan_ui/) using the UI.  This is generally the quickest way to see how your data fits into the DefectDojo model.

2. Now that you have data in DefectDojo, learn more about how to organize it with the [Product Hierarchy Overview](/asset_modelling/hierarchy/product_hierarchy/). The Product Hierarchy creates a working inventory of your apps, which helps you divide your data into logical categories, apply access control rules, sort Findings by [Priority and Risk](/asset_modelling/hierarchy/pro__priority_sla/) or to segment your reports to the correct team.

3. Check out your [Metrics pages](/metrics_reports/pro_metrics/pro__overview/) which can be used to quickly share Finding reports with key stakeholders.

This is the essence of DefectDojo - import security data, organize it, and present it to the folks who need to know.

All of these features can be automated, and because DefectDojo can handle over 200 tools (at time of writing) you should be all set to create a functional security inventory of your entire organizational output.

### Pro Features
- If your organization uses Jira, ServiceNow, AzureDevops, GitHub or GitLab for issue tracking, check out our [documentation](/issue_tracking/intro/intro/) on those integrations.
- Customize your [main Dashboard](/metrics_reports/dashboards/introduction_dashboard/) with filtered tiles to view your environment at a glance.
- Learn how to rapidly import data and mirror your team's existing security environment with [Connectors](/import_data/pro/connectors/about_connectors/).
