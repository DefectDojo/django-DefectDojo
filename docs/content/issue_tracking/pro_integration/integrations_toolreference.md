Here are specific instructions detailing how to set up a DefectDojo Integration with a third party Issue Tracker.

## Azure DevOps Boards

### Instance Setup

- **Label** should be the label that you want to use to identify this integration.
- **Location** should be set to your Azure URL - for example `https://dev.azure.com/{your organization}`
- **Token** should be set to a personal access token from Azure.

Authentication with Azure DevOps requires a [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows)
with permissions set to "Read, Write and Manage" for "Work Items" for the Azure Project that you wish to work with.

### Issue Tracker Mapping

These details dictate how DefectDojo will map Finding or Finding Group attributes to a given Project in Azure DevOps:

#### Issue Tracker Mapping Details

The `Project ID` field corresponds to the name or the ID of the Project in Azure.

#### Severity Mapping Details

The attributes in the form are supplied as defaults, and are as follows:

- **Severity Field Name**: `/fields/Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority`
- **Info Mapping**: `4`
- **Low Mapping**: `4`
- **Medium Mapping**: `3`
- **High Mapping**: `2`
- **Critical Mapping**: `1`

#### Status Mapping Details

The attributes in the form are supplied as defaults and are as follows:

- **Status Field Name**: `/fields/System.State`
- **Active Mapping**: `To Do`
- **Closed Mapping**: `Done`
- **False Positive Mapping**: `Done`
- **Risk Accepted Mapping**: `Done`

## GitHub

The GitHub integration allows you to add issues to a [GitHub Project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects), which also open Issues in an associated Repo.  These Repos/Projects can be associated with either a GitHub Organization or a personal GitHub account.

### Instance Setup

- **Label** should be the label that you want to use to identify this integration.
- **Location** should be set to your GitHub User or Organization URL, depending on where you wish to create issues. for example `https://github.com/{your-organization}`
- **Token** should be set to a personal access token from GitHub.

Personal access tokens for GitHub can be created at https://github.com/settings/tokens.  The token must have Repo and Project scopes.

### Issue Tracker Mapping

- **Issue Tracker Mapping Label** should be set to identify the Project or Repo that you wish to create Issues in.
- **Project Number** should be the ID of a GitHub project that you want to send items to.  You can get this from the URL while looking at a Project, for example `https://github.com/orgs/{your-org}/projects/{project number}`.
- **Repository Name** should be the name of a repo associated with your organization (or user) that you want to push Issues to.


### Severity Mapping Details

**In order to set up the integration, the Project MUST have a custom field created to represent Issue Priority, otherwise Severity will not be mapped correctly and Issues will not push to GitHub.**

Follow this guide to create a [custom field](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#creating-a-field-to-track-priority).
Each Severity will need to have a corresponding single-select option available.  For example, out of the box DefectDojo suggests P0, P1, P2, P3, P4 as possible Priority values, and each of those will need to be added to the Priority custom field.

- **Severity Field Name**: `Priority`
- **Info Mapping**: `P0`
- **Low Mapping**: `P1`
- **Medium Mapping**: `P2`
- **High Mapping**: `P3`
- **Critical Mapping**: `P4`

### Status Mapping Details

By default, new GitHub Projects will have Statuses for Issues of "In Progress" and "Done".  Additional statuses can be added to the Project to track False Positive or Risk Accepted status if you wish.  One of the ways this can be done is by adding a new Status Column to the Project Board.

- **Status Field Name**: `Status`
- **Active Mapping**: `In Progress`
- **Closed Mapping**: `Done`
- **False Positive Mapping**: `Done`
- **Risk Accepted Mapping**: `Done`

## GitLab

The GitLab integration allows you to add issues to a [GitLab Project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/).

### Instance Setup

- **Label** should be the label that you want to use to identify this integration.
- **Location** should be set to the link to your GitLab server, for example `https://gitlab.com/`.
- **Token** should be set to a personal access token from GitLab. The token must have API scopes. See [GitLab’s guide to creating a personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/#create-a-personal-access-token).

### Issue Tracker Mapping

- **Project Name**: The name of the project in GitLab that you want to send issues to.

### Severity Mapping Details

This maps to the GitLab Priority field.
- **Severity Field Name**: `Priority`
- **Info Mapping**: `1`
- **Low Mapping**: `2`
- **Medium Mapping**: `3`
- **High Mapping**: `4`
- **Critical Mapping**: `5`

### Status Mapping Details

By default, GitLab has statuses of 'opened' and 'closed'.  Additional status labels can be added if you want to track False Positive or Risk Accepted status.  See [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/work_items/status/) for details.

- **Status Field Name**: `Status`
- **Active Mapping**: `opened`
- **Closed Mapping**: `closed`
- **False Positive Mapping**: `closed`
- **Risk Accepted Mapping**: `closed`

## ServiceNow

The ServiceNow Integration allows you to push DefectDojo Findings as ServiceNow Incidents.

### Instance Setup

Your ServiceNow instance will require you to obtain a Refresh Token, associated with the User or Service account that will push Incidents to ServiceNow.

You'll need to start by creating an OAuth registration on your ServiceNow instance for DefectDojo:

1. In the left-hand navigation bar, search for “Application Registry” and select it.
2. Click “New”.
3. Choose “Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients”.
4. Fill in the required fields:
    * Name: Provide a meaningful name for your application (e.g., Vulnerability Integration Client).
    * (Optional) Adjust the Token Lifespan:
    * Access Token Lifespan: Default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
    * Refresh Token Lifespan: The default is 8640000 seconds (approximately 100 days).
5. Click Submit to create the application record.
6. After submission, select the application from the list and take note of the **Client ID and Client Secret** fields.

You will then need to use this registration to obtain a Refresh Token, which can only be obtained through the ServiceNow API.  Open a terminal window and paste the following (substituting the variables wrapped in `{{}}` with your user's actual information)

```
curl --request POST \
 --url {{INSTANCE_HOST}}/oauth_token.do \
 --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
 --data grant_type=password \
 --data 'client_id={{CLIENT_ID}}' \
 --data 'client_secret={{CLIENT_SECRET}}' \
 --data 'username={{USERNAME}}' \
 --data 'password={{PASSWORD}}'
 ```

If your ServiceNow credentials are correct, and allow for admin level-access to ServiceNow, you should receive a response with a RefreshToken.  You'll need that token to complete integration with DefectDojo.

- **Instance Label** should be the label that you want to use to identify this integration.
- **Location** should be set to the URL for your ServiceNow server, for example `https://your-organization.service-now.com/`.
- **Refresh Token** is where the Refresh Token should be entered.
- **Client ID** should be the Client ID set in the OAuth App Registration.
- **Client ID** should be the Client Secret set in the OAuth App Registration.

### Severity Mapping Details

This maps to the ServiceNow Impact field.
- **Info Mapping**: `1`
- **Low Mapping**: `1`
- **Medium Mapping**: `2`
- **High Mapping**: `3`
- **Critical Mapping**: `3`

### Status Mapping Details

- **Status Field Name**: `State`
- **Active Mapping**: `New`
- **Closed Mapping**: `Closed`
- **False Positive Mapping**: `Resolved`
- **Risk Accepted Mapping**: `Resolved`

## ServiceDesk Plus

The ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Integration allows you to push DefectDojo Findings and Finding Groups as ServiceDesk Plus requests, assigned to a support Group of your choice.  Both the **cloud** (ServiceDesk Plus OnDemand) and **on-premises** editions are supported by the same integration - the credentials you provide determine which mode is used.

### Instance Setup

- **Label** should be the label that you want to use to identify this integration.
- **Location** should be set to your ServiceDesk Plus URL: `https://sdpondemand.manageengine.com` for the cloud edition (or your regional equivalent), or your server's address for on-premises installs.

Then provide **one** of the two credential sets:

#### On-premises: Technician Key

- **Technician Key** should be an API key generated for a technician on your server, under **Admin > General Settings > API**.  Leave the Zoho OAuth fields empty.

#### Cloud: Zoho OAuth

The cloud edition authenticates through Zoho Accounts OAuth:

1. Open the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/) and create a **Self Client**.
2. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
3. In the Self Client's "Generate Code" tab, enter the scope `SDPOnDemand.requests.ALL`, choose a duration, and generate the code.
4. Exchange the code for a refresh token:

```
curl --request POST \
 --url 'https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token' \
 --data 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
 --data 'client_id={{CLIENT_ID}}' \
 --data 'client_secret={{CLIENT_SECRET}}' \
 --data 'code={{GENERATED_CODE}}'
```

5. Enter the **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, and the returned **Refresh Token** in the instance form.  If your account is hosted outside the US data center, set **Token URL** to your regional Zoho Accounts endpoint (for example `https://accounts.zoho.eu/oauth/v2/token`).

### Issue Tracker Mapping

- **Group Name** should be the name of the ServiceDesk Plus support group requests will be assigned to, exactly as it appears under **Admin > Users > Support Groups**.

### Severity Mapping Details

This maps to the ServiceDesk Plus request **Priority** field by name, using your account's priority names:

- **Severity Field Name**: `Priority`
- **Info Mapping**: `Low`
- **Low Mapping**: `Normal`
- **Medium Mapping**: `Medium`
- **High Mapping**: `High`
- **Critical Mapping**: `High`

### Status Mapping Details

This maps to the request **Status** field by name.  The defaults use the built-in statuses:

- **Status Field Name**: `Status`
- **Active Mapping**: `Open`
- **Closed Mapping**: `Closed`
- **False Positive Mapping**: `Closed`
- **Risk Accepted Mapping**: `On Hold`

A few ServiceDesk Plus-specific behaviors to be aware of:

- Updates sync the full request content - unlike most trackers, ServiceDesk Plus allows the subject and description to be edited after creation.
- Requests are closed rather than deleted when a Finding is removed; requests already Closed or Resolved are left untouched.
- If your account makes fields mandatory on closure (for example a resolution), a close pushed from DefectDojo may be rejected by those rules and will appear in the Integration errors table.
