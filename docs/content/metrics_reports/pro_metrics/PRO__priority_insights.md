The **Priority Insights** metrics page shows the most critical Findings as determined by Risk, Severity, Exploitability, or custom scoring, helping teams understand which vulnerabilities pose the greatest threat at any given moment and focus their efforts accordingly.

Apart from various charts and graphs, Priority Insights includes four clickable modals that will open a separate tab with a table for all of the data those four modals represent: 

* Total Urgent Risk Findings
* Total Needs Action Risk Findings
* Total Medium Risk Findings
* Average Finding Priority

It also includes an integrated table of Prioritized Findings arranged either by AppSec or SOC, allowing Users to further filter, interact with, and view the data associated with individual Findings. The contents can be exported as a CSV file or a Quick Report, and other various columns can be added prior to export.
