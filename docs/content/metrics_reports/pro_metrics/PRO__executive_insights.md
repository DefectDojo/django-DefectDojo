The **Executive Insights** metrics page provides an aggregated view of application security risk across your organization. As it is design for executive-level consumption, this dashboard focuses exclusively on Organizations and Assets, emphasizing trends and outcomes rather than individual Findings.

Within Executive Insights, Users may select a timeframe, Organization, Asset, or Tag from the filter list, which will populate an adjoining table with the resulting Findings. It will also change the results in various charts and graphs below. 

If no filters are selected, the table will display the status of all Organizations, Assets, and Tags. 

The first table provides a birdseye view of your overall security posture. There are also two separate tables for your Organizations and Assets.

Figures will populate within each table depending on the filters applied. Clicking any hyperlinked figure within a cell will open a separate tab with a corresponding Findings Table.
