Specifically, the Severity by Tool (Top 10 Most Findings) modal will provide a radar chart comparing the severity of the Findings your tools reveal. 

Severity by Tool Monthly will also provide a table arranged by the total Findings a particular scan type revealed on a particular date. Each column of this table can also be toggled to present in ascending or descending order.
