The **Remediation Insights** dashboard focuses on closure performance and remediation accountability, charting SLA adherence, overdue Findings, and Risk Acceptance over time. It relies on EPSS scores to determine a Finding’s exploitability, the database for which DefectDojo Pro updates daily and applies to each of your Findings.

Similar to Priority Insights, Remediation Insights also includes four clickable modals that will open a separate tab with a table for all of the data those four modals represent: 
* Total Open Findings 
* Critical & High Open Findings 
* Mitigated Within SLA 
* Highly Exploitable Findings
