<span style="background-color:rgba(242, 86, 29, 0.3)">Note: Automating the Report Builder with the REST API and an LLM is a DefectDojo Pro feature, currently in beta.</span>

DefectDojo Pro's Report Builder (Themes, Blocks, and Templates) is fully driven by the REST API. That means you can hand the whole job to an LLM: paste one self-contained prompt into Claude, ChatGPT, or any other capable model, and it will interrogate your tenant's live OpenAPI schema and `field_options`, propose a theme plus a reusable block library and templates for the audiences you name, emit a runnable Python script, and then run the report and download the finished file.

The pattern is simple. You provide your base URL, an API token, and a short description of who the reports are for. The LLM does the discovery, design, creation, verification, run, and download — pausing for your approval before it builds anything against your tenant.

This guide pairs with the [Report Builder API guide](../report-builder-api/), which documents the raw resources and request shapes the LLM is working with. If you want to understand or hand-tune what the LLM produced, that is the reference to keep open.

## Before you start

1. **Get an API token.** In the DefectDojo Pro UI, go to **User Settings → API v2 Key** and copy the token. Then set it as an environment variable so the generated script can read it without the token ever appearing in chat:

```shell
export DD_IMPORTER_DOJO_API_TOKEN=<paste-token-here>
```

2. **Decide your audiences.** The LLM will ask who the reports are for. Common choices:

   - **Executive Summary** — high-level posture; past-SLA, KEV, and asset inventory at a glance.
   - **POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)** — open findings with severity, due date, and recommended remediation, plus Critical detail and historical/closed findings.
   - **Integrated Inventory Workbook** — assets (formerly Products) in scope with criticality, platform, lifecycle, internet-accessibility, and finding counts.
   - **Deviation Request (DRF) Package** — active risk acceptances, DR-tagged findings, and past-SLA candidates for new deviation requests.
   - **Engineering Findings Detail** — full per-finding write-ups (description, impact, mitigation, references).
   - **Compliance / Audit Snapshot** — assets plus risk acceptances plus KEV.

> **💡 Tip:** You do not have to pick from this list. Tell the LLM your real audiences in plain language and it will map them onto the available entities and filters.

## The prompt

Copy the entire fenced block below and paste it into Claude, ChatGPT, or any other capable LLM. The prompt is self-contained — the model will ask you for your tenant URL, token environment variable, and report audiences, then walk you through discovery → design → create → verify → run → download.

You are helping me build, run, and download custom reports in DefectDojo Pro
using its REST API and "Report Generator" (Themes / Blocks / Templates /
Generated Reports).

================================================================================
DATA MODEL
================================================================================

DefectDojo Pro custom reports use these related REST resources (all under
/api/v2/):

  report_themes      visual style
  report_blocks      reusable content units (filters live here)
  report_templates   ordered blocks + a theme
  generated_reports  run a template and download the resulting PDF/HTML

A Template references Blocks by ID and a Theme by ID. A Block carries its own
filters, so reusing a Block reuses its filters identically everywhere. A
Generated Report runs a Template and produces a downloadable file.

================================================================================
THEMES
================================================================================

A Theme controls the visual style applied to a template. Its fields are:

  name              display name for the theme
  primary_color     7-char hex (default #1e3a5f)
  secondary_color   7-char hex (default #4a90a4)
  accent_color      7-char hex (default #e67e22)
  text_color        7-char hex (default #333333)
  background_color  7-char hex (default #ffffff)
  footer_text       text shown in the page footer
  show_page_numbers boolean -- whether to print page numbers
  header_image      optional image for the page header
  footer_image      optional image for the page footer

All color values are 7-character hex strings (e.g. "#1e3a5f").

================================================================================
BLOCK TYPES
================================================================================

A Block's `block_type` is one of: stock | tabular | detail
  - stock    : non-data content (cover_page, table_of_contents, page_break,
               image, text_block). Config goes in `stock_configuration`.
  - tabular  : a table of records from a DefectDojo entity. Config in
               `tabular_configuration`. Required: model_choice, fields[], ordering.
  - detail   : a per-record detail layout (good for long-text fields like
               description, impact, mitigation). Config in
               `detail_configuration`. Same required keys as tabular.

(A `chart` block type is reserved but not yet exposed via the API.)

`model_choice` is locked to one of EXACTLY these seven entities (this is an
enum in the OpenAPI schema -- do not invent others):

    organization | asset | engagement | test | finding | test_type | risk_acceptance

NOTE: Even if the tenant has REST endpoints like /api/v2/location/,
/api/v2/location_findings/, or /api/v2/location_products/, those are NOT
selectable as `model_choice`. Any "location" scoping must flow through asset
(formerly Product), tag, or organization (formerly Product Type) filters on
the supported entities.

================================================================================
FIELDS (columns) -- discover, never invent
================================================================================

For each entity above, the list of valid `fields` (column paths) plus which
paths are allowed for `tabular` vs `detail` blocks is exposed at:

    GET /api/v2/report_blocks/field_options/

You MUST fetch this before designing any block. Use only the `path` values it
returns. Some fields are `detail`-only (description, mitigation, impact,
references, etc.) because they hold long-form / markdown content.

================================================================================
FILTERS -- this is the most error-prone area; READ CAREFULLY
================================================================================

Each tabular/detail block accepts:

    "filter_entries": [
        {"field": "<filter_name>", "value": "<string_value>"},
        ...
    ]

The OpenAPI schema does NOT enumerate valid filter names. The valid vocabulary
is the GET query-parameter vocabulary of the underlying REST endpoint for that
entity. To discover the real filter names for an entity:

    finding         -> GET /api/v2/findings/         (look at `parameters`)
    asset           -> GET /api/v2/assets/          (formerly Products)
    engagement      -> GET /api/v2/engagements/
    test            -> GET /api/v2/tests/
    test_type       -> GET /api/v2/test_types/
    organization    -> GET /api/v2/organizations/   (formerly Product Types)
    risk_acceptance -> GET /api/v2/risk_acceptance/

The fastest way is to load the full OpenAPI schema once:

    GET /api/v2/oa3/schema/?format=json

then, for each entity, read
    schema['paths'][<endpoint>]['get']['parameters']
and use those `name` values as your filter `field` keys.

DO NOT invent UI-style filter names (older docs sometimes mention
`status_any`, `priority_greater_than`, or comma-separated multi-value strings
like "Critical,High"). The DD Pro server SILENTLY DROPS or rewrites any
filter_entry whose `field` does not match a real GET-parameter name on the
underlying endpoint. Examples of names that DO work, from a live 2.58.x
tenant, on findings:

    {"field": "active",          "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "verified",        "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "is_mitigated",    "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "risk_accepted",   "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "duplicate",       "value": "false"}    boolean
    {"field": "false_p",         "value": "false"}    boolean
    {"field": "out_of_scope",    "value": "false"}    boolean
    {"field": "severity",        "value": "Critical"} single value (NOT comma-separated)
    {"field": "known_exploited", "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "ransomware_used", "value": "true"}     boolean
    {"field": "outside_of_sla",  "value": "1"}        NUMERIC (not boolean string)
    {"field": "priority_min",    "value": "800"}      use _min / _max, not _greater_than
    {"field": "priority_max",    "value": "1000"}
    {"field": "tag",             "value": "DR"}       single tag
    {"field": "tags",            "value": "kev,pci"}  multiple tags (any-of)
    {"field": "tags__and",       "value": "kev,pci"}  multiple tags (all-of)
    {"field": "test__engagement__product",         "value": "<product_id>"}
    {"field": "test__engagement__product__prod_type","value": "<prod_type_id>"}
    {"field": "cve",             "value": "CVE-2024-12345"}
    {"field": "cwe",             "value": "79"}
    {"field": "planned_remediation_date_before", "value": "2025-12-31"}
    {"field": "date_before",     "value": "2025-12-31"}
    {"field": "date_after",      "value": "2025-01-01"}

Asset filters (examples confirmed on live tenant):

    {"field": "business_criticality", "value": "very_high"}
    {"field": "internet_accessible",  "value": "true"}
    {"field": "lifecycle",            "value": "production"}
    {"field": "platform",             "value": "web"}
    {"field": "tag",                  "value": "pci"}

Risk-acceptance filters (note: no `tag` filter exists here -- filter by
`decision`, `owner`, or `expiration_date` instead, or push the DR-marking
tag onto the underlying findings):

    {"field": "decision",         "value": "Accept (Transfer)"}
    {"field": "owner",            "value": "<user_id>"}
    {"field": "expiration_date_before", "value": "2025-12-31"}

Operational rules for filter_entries:

  - Single-value strings only. "Critical,High" in one severity entry will NOT
    keep both -- DefectDojo will store only "Critical". To cover multiple
    severities, create separate blocks (one per severity) or compose multiple
    filter rows where the underlying endpoint supports it (e.g. tags__and).
  - Booleans go as the LITERAL string "true" or "false".
  - PATCHing filter_entries REPLACES the whole list. Always send the full
    desired set; never assume merge semantics.
  - After POSTing a block, GET it back and compare the returned filter_entries
    against what you sent. If any entry is missing, the field name was rejected
    -- look it up in `parameters` on the corresponding REST endpoint.

================================================================================
TEMPLATES
================================================================================

A Template ties blocks together in order and binds them to a theme:

    POST /api/v2/report_templates/
    {
        "name":        "<name>",
        "description": "<short description>",
        "theme_id":    <theme_id>,
        "template_blocks_write": [
            {"order": 0, "block_id": <block_id>},
            {"order": 1, "block_id": <block_id>},
            ...
        ]
    }

The same `block_id` can appear multiple times (e.g. a "page break" block
reused several times in the same template).

================================================================================
GENERATED REPORTS -- run a template, then download the file
================================================================================

A Generated Report runs a Template and produces a downloadable file.

1. Kick off a run:

    POST /api/v2/generated_reports/
    {
        "template_id": <template_id>,
        "file_format": "pdf"      // or "html"
    }

   This returns a generated_reports record with an `id` and a `status`.

2. Poll until it finishes:

    GET /api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/

   `status` moves through: pending -> processing -> completed (or failed).
   Poll on an interval until it reaches "completed". If it reaches "failed",
   read `error_message` for the reason and stop.

3. Download the file once completed:

    GET /api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/download/

   This returns the binary PDF/HTML body. It returns 404 until status is
   "completed", so only call it after polling confirms completion. Save the
   response body to a file with the matching extension.

================================================================================
AUTH
================================================================================

Every request needs:

    Authorization: Token <my-api-token>
    Accept:        application/json
    Content-Type:  application/json   (on POST/PATCH)

Get the token from User Settings -> API v2 Key in the DefectDojo Pro UI.

================================================================================
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
================================================================================

1. Ask me for:
   - my DefectDojo Pro base URL (e.g. https://<tenant>.cloud.defectdojo.com/api/v2)
   - the env var name that holds my API token (default: DD_IMPORTER_DOJO_API_TOKEN)
   - the audiences/reports I want (e.g. Executive Summary, POA&M,
     Inventory Workbook, Deviation Request package, Engineering Detail,
     Compliance/Audit Snapshot)
   - any specific filters I care about (severity tiers, SLA cutoffs, KEV-only,
     specific assets, tags, etc.)
   - branding for the theme (primary/secondary/accent colors, footer text,
     whether to show page numbers)
   - which output format I want for the run: "pdf" or "html"

2. Discover the live vocabulary BEFORE designing anything:
   - GET /api/v2/oa3/schema/?format=json    and save locally
   - GET /api/v2/report_blocks/field_options/   and save locally
   - For each entity I want to report on, extract the GET parameters from the
     schema and show me the candidate filter names so we agree on vocabulary.

3. Propose a design back to me consisting of:
   - one shared theme (with the branding from step 1)
   - a reusable Block library (cover page, page breaks, intro text blocks,
     and the data tables/details I need)
   - 1+ Templates that compose those blocks for the audiences I named
   For every data block, show me: model_choice, fields[], ordering, and the
   exact filter_entries list. Wait for my approval.

4. Once I approve, generate a SINGLE Python script (stdlib only, urllib --
   no extra dependencies needed) that:
   - reads the token from the env var I named
   - POSTs the theme, then the blocks, then the templates (in that order,
     because templates reference block IDs and a theme ID)
   - prints each returned ID as it goes
   - dumps everything to a created.json file for verification
   - THEN runs and downloads the report (see steps 6-8 below) as part of the
     same script
   Show me the full script before running it.

5. After creating, VERIFY:
   - GET each created block back and confirm filter_entries persisted
     EXACTLY as POSTed. If any entry is missing, that field name was rejected
     by DD -- look it up in `parameters` on the relevant REST endpoint and
     PATCH the block with the corrected vocabulary.
   - GET each template back and confirm the block_id list and order, plus
     theme_id binding, are correct.

6. RUN the report:
   - POST /api/v2/generated_reports/ with
     { "template_id": <template_id>, "file_format": "pdf" }  (or "html")
   - capture the returned generated report `id`.

7. POLL until done:
   - GET /api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/ on a short interval.
   - statuses progress: pending -> processing -> completed/failed.
   - stop polling when status is "completed".
   - if status is "failed", read and print `error_message`, then stop.

8. DOWNLOAD the file:
   - once status is "completed", GET /api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/download/
     (it 404s until completed) and save the response body to a file with the
     correct extension (.pdf or .html).
   - print the saved file path.

9. If I later want to tune a filter, swap a block, or change colors:
   - PATCH the existing resource (do not recreate).
   - When PATCHing filter_entries, send the FULL desired list -- it replaces,
     not merges.
   - Re-run steps 6-8 to regenerate the file.

================================================================================
HARD CONSTRAINTS
================================================================================

- Do NOT invent field paths or filter names. If unsure, GET field_options
  (for column paths) or the entity's GET parameters (for filter names) and
  use only what's there.
- Do NOT use "Critical,High" or other comma-separated values inside a single
  severity/status filter_entry value -- DD will keep only the first match.
  Use one block per value, or use multi-value filters that DD's underlying
  endpoint explicitly supports (e.g. `tags`, `tags__and`).
- Do NOT use the older UI-style filter names like `status_any`,
  `priority_greater_than`, `mitigated_within_sla`, or `severity__in`. They
  are silently dropped.
- Do NOT call the download endpoint before status is "completed" -- it 404s.
- Show me each batch of commands or the full script before running it.
- Stop and ask if anything in the schema is ambiguous rather than guessing.

Start by asking me for the base URL, the env var name holding the token, my
audience goals, theme branding, and my preferred output format.
```

## How to use it

1. **Paste the prompt** above into Claude, ChatGPT, or another capable LLM.
2. **Answer its discovery questions.** It will ask for your base URL, the environment variable holding your token, your audiences, any specific filters you care about (severity tiers, SLA cutoffs, KEV-only, particular assets or tags), your branding, and the output format you want.
3. **Review the proposed design and approve before it builds.** The model should come back with one shared theme, a reusable block library, and one or more templates — showing, for every data block, the `model_choice`, `fields`, ordering, and exact filter entries. Do not let it create anything against your tenant until you have signed off.
4. **Let it generate and run the script.** The single Python script (standard library only) creates the theme, blocks, and templates, then runs the report and downloads the finished file.
5. **It should verify before and after the run.** Expect it to GET each block and template back to confirm filters and ordering persisted, then POST to `generated_reports`, poll until status is `completed`, and download the file.

> **💡 Tip:** If the LLM jumps straight to designing blocks without first fetching your tenant's live schema (`/api/v2/oa3/schema/?format=json`) and `field_options`, push back. Filter and field names vary by version, and designing from memory is exactly how blocks end up silently missing filters.

## Troubleshooting

**A created block comes back missing filters you sent.** The filter `field` name did not match a real GET parameter on the underlying entity, so DefectDojo dropped it. Have the LLM fetch `/api/v2/oa3/schema/?format=json`, read the `parameters` list for that entity's GET endpoint (for example the findings endpoint), and use a real parameter name.

**Boolean filters are not taking effect.** Boolean values must be sent as the strings `"true"` or `"false"`, not actual JSON booleans.

**`outside_of_sla` is not filtering.** That filter takes a numeric value as a string — use `"1"`, not `"true"`.

**Multiple severities in one block do not work.** A single block keeps only the first severity. Split into one block per severity instead.

**Template blocks come back in the wrong order or missing.** Make sure the LLM POSTed `template_blocks_write` (the write-only field), not `template_blocks` (which is read-only). The `order` field is required on every entry.

**The report run is stuck or failed.** Keep polling `GET /api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/` — status moves from `pending` to `processing` to `completed`. If status becomes `failed`, read the `error_message` field for the cause before retrying.

> **⚠️** The download endpoint (`/api/v2/generated_reports/{id}/download/`) returns 404 until the run reaches `completed`. Always poll to completion before downloading.

## Next steps

- [Report Builder (UI)](../report-builder/) — design and run reports interactively in the DefectDojo Pro interface.
- [Report Builder API](../report-builder-api/) — the raw REST resources and request shapes the LLM is working with, for hand-tuning or deeper automation.
