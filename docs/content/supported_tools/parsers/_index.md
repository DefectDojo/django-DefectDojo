DefectDojo can parse data from 180+ security reports and counting.

## DefectDojo Pro Methods
<span style="background-color:rgba(242, 86, 29, 0.3)">DefectDojo Pro</span> users have enhanced methods of import available for certain tools.

**Connectors** allow you to automatically import and sync vulnerabilities from certain tools.

**Smart Upload** allows you to split infrastructure-wide scan files up by component or endpoint, and easily combine those results with other Findings from the same location.

# All Supported Tools

All of these listed reports can be ingested via [Import/Reimport](/en/connecting_your_tools/import_intro) methods. This means that they can be imported to both Open-Source and Pro instances using the UI or API.

If your tool is not in this list, there's a good chance that DefectDojo can still import a report from the tool.  Consider the [Generic Findings Import](/supported_tools/parsers/generic_findings_import/) method.

<span style="background-color:rgba(242, 86, 29, 0.3)">DefectDojo Pro</span> users can import any JSON or CSV report using the [Universal Parser](/en/connecting_your_tools/universal_parser).
