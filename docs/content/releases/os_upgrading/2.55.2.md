## JIRA Reconciliation

The `jira_status_reconciliation` management command now also processes JIRA issues for Finding Groups.

New command line options:

- `--include-findings` / `--no-include-findings` — Process individual findings with direct JIRA issues (default: True)
- `--include-finding-groups` / `--no-include-finding-groups` — Process finding groups with JIRA issues (default: True)

Full list of options:

    docker compose exec uwsgi bash -c "python manage.py jira_status_reconciliation --help"

    usage: manage.py jira_status_reconciliation [-h] [--mode MODE] [--product PRODUCT]
