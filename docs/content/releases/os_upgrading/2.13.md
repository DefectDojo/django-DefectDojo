The last release implemented the search for vulnerability ids, but the search database was not initialized. To populate the database table of the vulnerability ids, execute this django command from the defect dojo installation directory or from a shell of the Docker container or Kubernetes pod:

`./manage.py migrate_cve`

Additionally this requires a one-time rebuild of the Django-Watson search index. Execute this django command from the defect dojo installation directory or from a shell of the Docker container or Kubernetes pod:

`./manage.py buildwatson`

**Further changes:**

Legacy authorization for changing configurations based on staff users has been removed.
