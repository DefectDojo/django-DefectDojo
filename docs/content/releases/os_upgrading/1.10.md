**1.10.4 is a security release**

-   See the security advisory:
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/security/advisories/GHSA-96vq-gqr9-vf2c>
-   See release notes:
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.10.4>
-   Version 1.10.4 replaces 1.10.3 as the latter contained an incomplete
    fix

**What\'s New:**

-   See release notes:
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases>
-   DefectDojo now provides a `settings.py` file
    out-of-the-box. Custom settings need to go into
    `local\_settings.py`. See
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/settings/settings.py>
    and
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/docker/extra_settings/README.md>
-   A quickfix is to rename your own / customized
    `settings.py` or `settings.dist.py` to
    `local\_settings.py`. Details of that PR:
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/3136>
-   Major JIRA integration refactoring, for which you should at least
    use 1.10.1 and not 1.10.0 for many bug fixes.

**Breaking changes**

Kubernetes/Helm users: we have moved away from the \"stable\" repository
to \"bitnami\" in this release. The bitnami postgresql chart required us
to add a new key to the postgresql secret, which will give you the error
`postgresql-postgres-password is missing` if you have
`createPostgresqlSecret: false`. In 1.10.1, a fix was also included to
allow your existing `postgresqlPassword` to be reused properly.

Including in 1.10.1 were a couple fixes related to a rabbitMQ upgrade.
The path to access `password`, `erlangCookie` and
`existingPasswordSecret` changed from `rabbitmq` to `auth`. Furthermore,
as rabbitMQ is deployed as a StatefulSet, an in-place upgrade is not
possible and an error will likely be thrown such as
`Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden`.
After ensuring your rabbitMQ celery queue is empty, you will then want
to delete your rabbitMQ StatefulSet and PVC to allow them to get
re-created, or fully delete and recreate defectdojo.
