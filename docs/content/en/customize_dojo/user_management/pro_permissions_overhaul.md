Permissions in <span style="background-color:rgba(242, 86, 29, 0.3)">DefectDojo Pro</span> have been simplified, to make it easier to assign object access.  This feature can be accessed through the [Beta UI](/en/about_defectdojo/ui_pro_vs_os/).

### Opening the Permissions window

When looking at Product Type or Product, you can open the Permissions window to set permissions quickly.  This menu can be found in a Table by clicking the horizontal dots **"‚ãÆ"**.  IF looking at an individual **Product** or **Product Type** page, this menu can be found under the blue gear ‚Äò‚öôÔ∏è‚Äô.

## Setting Permissions through the permissions window

1. At the top of this window, you can choose to manage permissions for an individual user or for a [user group](../create_user_group).
2. Here, you can select a user or group to add to the Product, and select  the [Role](../about_perms_and_roles) that you want that user to have.
3. On the lower table, you can see a list of all users or groups who have access to this object.  You can also quickly assign a new role for one of these users or groups from the drop-down menu.
