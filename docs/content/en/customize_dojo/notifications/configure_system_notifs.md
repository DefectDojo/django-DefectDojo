DefectDojo has two different kinds of notifications: **Personal** (sent to a single account) and **System** (which are sent to all users).

Both an account’s Personal Notifications and the global System Notifications can be configured from the same page: **⚙️Configuration \> Notifications** in the sidebar.

2. From the Scope drop down menu, you can select which set of notifications you wish to edit.
