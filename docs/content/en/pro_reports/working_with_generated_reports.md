# Use a report as a Template


DefectDojo allows you to easily create Report templates with your team logo, boilerplate text and a standardized content order.



If you want to change the way a report is set up, or create a new one with a similar layout, you can re\-open the Report Builder by selecting **View Template** from the **â‹®** menu next to the report you wish to use as a template.



There are two places where you can find a Report Template to use:


1. From the **Generated Reports** page, where you can see a list of completed reports
2. From the **Report Templates** page, where you can see a list of previously run reports, including reports which were deleted from the **Generated Reports** page.

Both of these pages can be found in the ðŸ“„ **Reports** tab on the sidebar.

To access the **Report Templates** page, open ðŸ“„**Reports \> Report Templates** from the sidebar. From that table, you can open the report builder by clicking the **â‹®** menu next to the report you wish to use as a template.



Every time you make changes to a template or previous report, the result will be saved as a **new** report under Generated Reports so that you don't lose the older version. If you like, the older version can be deleted.




# Re\-Running a Report


DefectDojo Reports are â€˜frozen in timeâ€™ \- to keep your records consistent, they do not update automatically when DefectDojo experiences data changes.



However, if you want to create an updated version of a previously created report, you can do so by selecting **Re\-run Report** from the **â‹®** menu next to the report you wish to generate.



Selecting this option will create a new report in the **Generated Reports** list, with a different **Created** timestamp to indicate that the report was run at a separate time.

# Deleting a Report


If you no longer need a report, you can delete it by selecting **Delete Report** from the **â‹®** menu next to the report you wish to delete. Note that this will only remove the report from the **Generated Reports** list \- a record of the report will still exist under **Report Templates** if you want to re\-run it.
