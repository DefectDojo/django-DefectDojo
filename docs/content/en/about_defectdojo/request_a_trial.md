If your team requires an on\-premise DefectDojo installation, please connect with our Sales team by emailing \-\> [info@defectdojo.com](mailto:info@defectdojo.com) . This trial setup process only applies to DefectDojo Cloud users.


All DefectDojo plans include a free 2\-week trial, which you can use to evaluate our software. DefectDojo Trial instances are fully\-featured and can be immediately converted to our team into paid instances \- no need to set everything up again, or reupload any data when your trial period ends.



# **Requesting your Trial**


In order to sign up for the trial, you'll need to complete the process at <https://www.defectdojo.com/pricing>.



At the end of this process, you'll be put in touch with our Sales team, who will follow up to receive your billing information, and authorize and set up your company's trial instance.



## Step 1: Select a Plan


DefectDojo offers 4 plan tiers: Entry, Team, Business and Enterprise. For more information on these plan tiers, see <https://www.defectdojo.com/pricing>.



## Step 2: Enter your Company Information \& create your Domain


Enter your company's **Name** and the **Server Label** you want to use with DefectDojo. You will then have a custom domain created for your DefectDojo instance on our servers.




Normally, DefectDojo will name your domain according to your Company Name., but if you select "Use Server Label in Domain", DefectDojo will instead label your domain according to the Server Label you chose. This approach may be preferred if you plan to use multiple DefectDojo instances (such as a Production instance and a Test instance, for example). Please contact our Sales team \-\> [info@defectdojo.com](mailto:info@defectdojo.com) if you require multiple instances.

## Step 3: Select a Server Location


Select a Server Location from the drop\-down menu. We recommend selecting a server that is geographically closest to the main DefectDojo team to reduce server latency.

## Step 4: Configure your Firewall Rules
