If your team requires an on\-premise DefectDojo installation, please connect with our Sales team by emailing \-\> [info@defectdojo.com](mailto:info@defectdojo.com) . This trial setup process only applies to DefectDojo Cloud users.

All DefectDojo plans include a free 2\-week trial, which you can use to evaluate our software. DefectDojo Trial instances are fully\-featured and can be immediately converted to our team into paid instances \- no need to set everything up again, or reupload any data when your trial period ends.

At the end of this process, you'll be put in touch with our Sales team, who will follow up to receive your billing information, and authorize and set up your company's trial instance.

# **Requesting your Trial**

In order to sign up for a trial, you'll need to create an account on our Cloud Portal, and then click the New Subscription menu option from the sidebar.

## Step 2: Enter your Company Information \& create your Domain

Enter your company's **Name** and the **Server Label** you want to use with DefectDojo. You will then have a custom domain created for your DefectDojo instance on our servers.

Normally, DefectDojo will name your domain according to your Company Name., but if you select "Use Server Label in Domain", DefectDojo will instead label your domain according to the Server Label you chose. This approach may be preferred if you plan to use multiple DefectDojo instances (such as a Production instance and a Test instance, for example). Please contact our Sales team \-\> [info@defectdojo.com](mailto:info@defectdojo.com) if you require multiple instances.

## Step 3: Select a Server Location

Select a Server Location from the drop\-down menu. We recommend selecting a server that is geographically closest to the main DefectDojo team to reduce server latency.

## Step 4: Configure your Firewall Rules

Enter the IP address ranges, subnet mask and labels that you want to allow to access DefectDojo. Additional IP addresses and rules can be added or changed by your team after your instance is up and running.

If you want to use external services with DefectDojo (GitHub or JIRA), check the appropriate boxes listed under **Select External Services.** 

## Step 5: Confirm your Plan type and Billing Frequency

Before you complete the process, please confirm the plan you want to use along with your billing frequency \- monthly or annually.

## Step 6: Review and Submit your Request

We'll prompt you to look over your request one more time. Once submitted, only Firewall rules can be changed by your team without assistance from Support. To contact Support, please email [support@defectdojo.com](mailto:support@defectdojo.com) or follow the instructions in [this article](https://docs.defectdojo.com/en/about_defectdojo/contact_defectdojo_support/).

* Checkout With Stripe will take you to a Stripe page where you can enter your billing information.
* If you do not wish to enter your billing info at this time, you can click Contact Sales - our Sales team will be in touch to set up your trial.

# Once your trial has been approved

Our Support team will send you a Welcome email with links and an initial password to access your DefectDojo instance. You can always reach out to [support@defectdojo.com](mailto:support@defectdojo.com) for product assistance once your trial begins.
