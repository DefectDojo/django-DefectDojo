DefectDojo keeps you up to date in a variety of ways. Notifications can be sent for upcoming Engagements, user Mentions, SLA expiry, and other events in the software.

This article contains an overview of notifications at both System\-wide and Personal levels.

## Notification Types

DefectDojo handles notifications in two different ways::

* **System\-Wide Notifications** are sent to all users.
* **Personal Notifications are set by individual users, and will be received in addition to any System\-Wide Notifications.**

In both cases, [Role\-Based Access Control](https://docs.defectdojo.com/en/user_management/about-permissions--roles/) rules apply, so users will not receive activity notifications for Products or Product Types (or their related objects) which they donâ€™t have access to.

## Notification Delivery Methods

There are four delivery methods for DefectDojo notifications:

* DefectDojo can share **ðŸ”” Alerts,** stored as a list in the DefectDojo interface
* DefectDojo can send notifications to an **Email** address
* DefectDojo can send notifications to **Slack,** in either a shared or individual channel
* DefectDojo can also send notifications to **Microsoft Teams** in a shared channel

Notifications can be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.

Receiving Slack and Teams notifications will require you to have a working integration. For more info, see our articles:

* [Teams Integration](https://docs.defectdojo.com/en/notifications/configure-a-microsoft-teams-integration/)
