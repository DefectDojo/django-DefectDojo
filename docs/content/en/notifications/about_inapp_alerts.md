## Notes On Alerts


* Reading an Alert, or opening the Alerts Page will not remove any Alerts from the count next to the bell icon. This is so that you can easily access past alerts to use them as reminders or a personal activity log.
* Using the **Clear All Alerts \>** function in the Alerts Menu will also completely clear the **Alerts Page**, so use this feature with care.
* Removing an Alertonly affects your own Alerts List \- it will not affect any other userâ€™s Alerts.
* Removing an Alert does not remove any import history or activity logs from DefectDojo.
