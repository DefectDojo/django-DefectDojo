DefectDojo keeps you up to date in a variety of ways. Notifications can be sent for upcoming Engagements, user Mentions, SLA expiry, and other events in the software.



This article contains an overview of notifications at both System\-wide and Personal levels.




# Notification Types


DefectDojo handles notifications in two different ways::


* **System\-Wide Notifications** are sent to all users.
* **Personal Notifications are set by individual users, and will be received in addition to any System\-Wide Notifications.**

In both cases, [Role\-Based Access Control](https://support.defectdojo.com/en/collections/6542284-user-management) rules apply, so users will not receive activity notifications for Products or Product Types (or their related objects) which they donâ€™t have access to.




# Notification Delivery Methods


There are four delivery methods for DefectDojo notifications:


* DefectDojo can share **ðŸ”” Alerts,** stored as a list in the DefectDojo interface
* DefectDojo can send notifications to an **Email** address
* DefectDojo can send notifications to **Slack,** in either a shared or individual channel
* DefectDojo can also send notifications to **Microsoft Teams** in a shared channel

Notifications can be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.




Receiving Slack and Teams notifications will require you to have a working integration. For more info, see our articles:
