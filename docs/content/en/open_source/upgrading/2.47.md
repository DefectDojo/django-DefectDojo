### Drop support for PostgreSQL-HA in HELM

This release removes support for the PostgreSQL-HA (High Availability) Helm chart as a dependency in the DefectDojo Helm chart. Users relying on the PostgreSQL-HA Helm chart will need to transition to using the standard PostgreSQL configuration or an external PostgreSQL database.

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.47.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.47.0) for the contents of the release.

## Removal of Asynchronous Import

Please note that asynchronous import has been removed as it was announced in 2.46. If you haven't migrated from this feature yet, we recommend doing before upgrading to 2.47.0
