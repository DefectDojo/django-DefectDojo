### Drop support for PostgreSQL-HA in HELM

This release removes support for the PostgreSQL-HA (High Availability) Helm chart as a dependency in the DefectDojo Helm chart. Users relying on the PostgreSQL-HA Helm chart will need to transition to using the standard PostgreSQL configuration or an external PostgreSQL database.

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.47.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.47.0) for the contents of the release.
