### Drop support for PostgreSQL-HA in HELM

This release removes support for the PostgreSQL-HA (High Availability) Helm chart as a dependency in the DefectDojo Helm chart. Users relying on the PostgreSQL-HA Helm chart will need to transition to using the standard PostgreSQL configuration or an external PostgreSQL database.

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.47.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.47.0) for the contents of the release.

## Removal of Asynchronous Import

Please note that asynchronous import has been removed as it was announced in 2.46. If you haven't migrated from this feature yet, we recommend doing before upgrading to 2.47.0

## Wizcli Parsers Hashcode Changes
**Hash Code changes** Wizcli parsers have been updated to populate more fields in release 2.47.3. Some of these fields are part of the hash code calculation. To recalculate the hash code please execute the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe --parser 'Wizcli Img Scan' --hash_code_only"
docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe --parser 'Wizcli Dir Scan' --hash_code_only"
docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe --parser 'Wizcli IaC Scan' --hash_code_only"
```

This command has various command line arguments to tweak its behaviour, for example to trigger a run of the deduplication process. See dedupe.py for more information.
