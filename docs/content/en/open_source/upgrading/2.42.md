**Hash Code changes**
The Rusty Hog parser has been [updated](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/11433) to populate more fields. Some of these fields are part of the hash code calculation. To recalculate the hash code please execute the following command:

    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Horusec Scan" --hash_code_only`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Qualys Hacker Guardian Scan --hash_code_only"`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Red Hat Satellite --hash_code_only"`

This command has various command line arguments to tweak its behaviour, for example to trigger a run of the deduplication process.
See [dedupe.py](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/management/commands/dedupe.py) for more information.

Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.42.0) for the contents of the release.
