## Tag Formatting Update
In [2.46.0](../2.46) tag validation was added to disallow commas, spaces and quotes in tags. Some parsers were still creating tags with invalid characters. This is fixed in this release and this release will run another data migration to replace any invalid character in tag with an underscore '`_`'.
