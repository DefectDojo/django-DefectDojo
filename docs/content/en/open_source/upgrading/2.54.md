## Breaking change: `DD_PARSER_EXCLUDE` removed

To simplify the management of the DefectDojo application, parser exclusions are no longer controlled via the environment variable DD_PARSER_EXCLUDE or application settings. This variable is now unsupported.
From now on, you should use the active flag in the Test_Type model to enable or disable parsers. Only parsers associated with active Test_Type entries will be available for use.

## Import/reimport performance improvements

DefectDojo 2.54.x includes performance improvements for importing and reimporting scan results, especially for large scans:

- **Faster imports and reimports** due to fewer database queries and more bulk operations.
- **Reduced database load** during reimport matching and post-processing (helps avoid slowdowns/timeouts under heavy scan volume).
- **More efficient endpoint status updates** during reimport of dynamic findings.
- **Less churn when updating vulnerability IDs**, avoiding unnecessary deletes/writes when nothing changed.

No action is required after upgrading. (Optional tuning knobs exist via `DD_IMPORT_REIMPORT_MATCH_BATCH_SIZE` and `DD_IMPORT_REIMPORT_DEDUPE_BATCH_SIZE`.)

There are other instructions for upgrading to 2.54.x. Check the Release Notes for the contents of the release: `https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.54.0`
