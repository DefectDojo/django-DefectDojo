description: Dropped support for DD_PARSER_EXCLUDE
---

To simplify the management of the DefectDojo application, parser exclusions are no longer controlled via the environment variable DD_PARSER_EXCLUDE or application settings. This variable is now unsupported.
From now on, you should use the active flag in the Test_Type model to enable or disable parsers. Only parsers associated with active Test_Type entries will be available for use.

There are other instructions for upgrading to 2.54.x. Check the Release Notes for the contents of the release.
