**Upgrade instructions for helm chart with rabbitMQ enabled**: The rabbitMQ uses a statefulset by default. Before upgrading the helm chart we have to ensure that all queues are empty:

```bash
kubectl exec -i <name_of_the_rabbitmq_pod>  -- rabbitmqctl list_queues
```

Next step is to delete rabbitMQ pvc:

```bash
kubectl delete  pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=rabbitmq
```

Last step is to perform the upgrade.
