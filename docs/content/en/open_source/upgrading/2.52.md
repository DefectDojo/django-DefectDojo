description: Replaced Redis with Valkey
---

Since the license change at Redis the fork ValKey has become widely popular and is backed by industry giants such as AWS. AWS is advising to use ValKey over Redis and is using lower prices for ValKey compared to Redis.

Defect Dojo 2.52 now uses ValKey as a message broker. Teh existing redit volume can be used by Valkey, so this is just a drop in replacement.

If you want to know more or have a setup where you cannot just re-use the existing volume, please visit https://valkey.io/topics/migration/.
