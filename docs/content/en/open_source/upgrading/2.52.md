## Helm Chart Changes

This release introduces more important changes to the Helm chart configuration:

### Breaking changes

#### Security context

This Helm chart extends security context capabilities to all deployed pods and containers.
You can define a default pod and container security context globally using `securityContext.podSecurityContext` and `securityContext.containerSecurityContext` keys.
Additionally, each deployment can specify its own pod and container security contexts, which will override or merge with the global ones. 

#### Fine-grained resources

Now each container can specify the resource requests and limits.

#### Moved values

The following Helm chart values have been modified in this release:

- `securityContext.djangoSecurityContext` → deprecated in favor of container-specific security contexts (`celery.beat.containerSecurityContext`, `celery.worker.containerSecurityContext`, `django.uwsgi.containerSecurityContext` and `dbMigrationChecker.containerSecurityContext`)
- `securityContext.nginxSecurityContext` → deprecated in favor of container-specific security contexts (`django.nginx.containerSecurityContext`)

### Other changes

- **Extra annotations**: Now we can add common annotations to all resources.

There are other instructions for upgrading to 2.52.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.52.0) for the contents of the release.
