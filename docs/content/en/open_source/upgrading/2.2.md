Upgrade to 2.0.0 contained migration of endpoints. Some parts of migration haven't been done properly. This deficiency
may manifest as a doubled slash in endpoint URLs (like `http://foo.bar:8080//test`) or as a problem with deduplication
of the same endpoints. The mentioned bug was fixed in 2.2.0 and if you have seen these kinds of problems, just rerun
"Endpoint migration" as it is written in [Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 2.0.x.](#upgrading-to-defectdojo-version-20x).
