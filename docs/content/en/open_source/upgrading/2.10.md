**Breaking change for Findings:** The field `cve` will be replaced by a list of Vulnerability Ids, which can store references to security advisories associated with this finding. These can be Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or from other sources, eg. GitHub Security Advisories. Although the field does still exist in the code, the API and the UI have already been changed to use the list of Vulnerability Ids. Other areas like hash code calculation, search and parsers will be migrated step by step in later stages.

This change also causes an API change for the endpoint `/engagements/{id}/accept_risks/`.
