There are new docker images based on alpine with fewer third party dependencies. Related to the new images the current docker files had to be renamed and have a "-debian" or the new images a "-alpine" at the end. Furthermore there are new docker tags [DefectdojoVersion]-[OS]. For example 2.19.0-alpine or 2.19.0-debian. The currend tags (latest and [DefectdojoVersion]) are still based on the "old" images. Be aware that the new alpine images are not heavily tested and may contain bugs.

**Breaking Change**

In version 2.19.3, the GitHub OAuth integration has been removed to prevent configurations that may allow more access than intended.
