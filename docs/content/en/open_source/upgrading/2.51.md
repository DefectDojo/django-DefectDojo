## GitHub Scan Type and Parser Updates
The Github Vulnerability scan type and parser has been split into two disctinct scan types:
- [Github Vulnerability](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/docs/content/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/github_vulnerability.md) (original)
- [Github SAST](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/docs/content/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/github_sast.md)

The original Github Vulnerability scan type will continue to accept SCA vulnerabilities uploaded in GitHub's GraphQL format, as it has always done. However, it will no longer accept GitHub Advanced Security code scanning results. Instead, please use the new Github SAST scan type for uploading these types of vulnerabilities. This new scan type will accept the raw JSON response from [GitHub's REST API for code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning). Sample Github SAST scan data can be found [here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/tree/master/unittests/scans/github_sast).

Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.51.0) for the contents of the release.
