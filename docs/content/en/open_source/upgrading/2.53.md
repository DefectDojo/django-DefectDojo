## Helm Chart Changes

This release introduces an important change to the Helm chart configuration for the initializer job and support for HPA and PDB.

### New values

Added Helm chart support for Celery and Django deployments for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler using `.autoscaling` fields under each section. And Pod Disruption Budget using `.podDisruptionBudget` for any of Celery Beat/Worker or Django deploy

### Breaking changes

#### Initializer Annotation Handling

- **Renamed initializer annotations**: The `initializer.annotations` field has been renamed to `initializer.podAnnotations` for clarity and consistency with other DefectDojo resources.
- **Merged annotation support**: Global `extraAnnotations` are now automatically merged with the initializer's `podAnnotations` to ensure consistent annotation handling across all resources.

> The previous implementation did not merge global `extraAnnotations` with the initializer job's pod annotations, causing inconsistencies in annotation management.

#### Moved values

The following Helm chart values have been modified in this release:

- `initializer.annotations` → `initializer.podAnnotations` (applies to Pod template metadata within the Job)

Note: `initializer.jobAnnotations` affects the Job spec metadata, while `initializer.podAnnotations` affects the Pod template metadata within the Job.

#### Migration

If you were using:

```yaml
initializer:
  annotations:
    foo: bar
```

Update to:

```yaml
initializer:
  podAnnotations:
    foo: bar
```

Both `extraAnnotations` and `initializer.podAnnotations` will now be properly applied to the initializer pod.

## Reimport updates fields fix_available and fix_version

Reimport will update existing findings `fix_available` and `fix_version` fields based on the incoming scan report.
