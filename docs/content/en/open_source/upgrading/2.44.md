### Hash Code changes

The Burp parser now has a custom deduplication configuration to make deduplication more accurate. To recalculate the hash code and deduplicate existing Burp findings, please execute the following command:

    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Burp Scan" --hash_code_only`

This command has various command line arguments to tweak its behavior, for example to trigger a run of the deduplication process.
See [dedupe.py](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/management/commands/dedupe.py) for more information.
