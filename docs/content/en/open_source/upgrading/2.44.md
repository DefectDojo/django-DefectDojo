### Hash Code changes

The Burp parser now has a custom deduplication configuration to make deduplication more accurate. To recalculate the hash code and deduplicate existing Burp findings, please execute the following command:

    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Burp Scan" --hash_code_only`

This command has various command line arguments to tweak its behavior, for example to trigger a run of the deduplication process.
See [dedupe.py](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/management/commands/dedupe.py) for more information.

### Import / Reimport Statistics Delta

Following a successful import or reimport, a JSON blob for `statistics` is generated to provide the differential of finding activity.
There was a section in the `delta` JSON blob that refferred to a key labeled `left untouched`. This value does not comply with REST
norms, and has been renamed to `left_untouched`. Here is a before and after to make it clear:

Before:

    "statistics": {
        "before": {},
        "delta": {
        "created": {},
        "closed": {},
        "reactivated": {},
        "left untouched": {}
        },
        "after": {}
    }

After:

    "statistics": {
        "before": {},
        "delta": {
        "created": {},
        "closed": {},
        "reactivated": {},
        "left_untouched": {}
        },
        "after": {}
    }
