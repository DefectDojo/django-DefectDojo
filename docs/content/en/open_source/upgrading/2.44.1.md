### AWS Parser Endpoint Migrations

The structure of AWS Endpoints changed slightly. In the past ARNs of Services were imported with invalid digits leading to broken Endpoints.
The Endpoints thus changed slightly. ":", " " & "/" are replaced by "_".

An Migration is added as part of this release to avoid duplicates at the next import. It can take some time, depending on the amount of AWS Endpoints in the DB.
