### Merge of MobSF parsers

Mobsfscan Scan" has been merged into the "MobSF Scan" parser. The "Mobsfscan Scan" scan_type has been retained to keep deduplication working for existing Tests, but users are encouraged to move to the "MobSF Scan" scan_type.

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.49.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.49.0) for the contents of the release.
