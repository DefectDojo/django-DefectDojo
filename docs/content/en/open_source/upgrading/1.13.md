description: hashcode calculation logic has changed

- See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.13.0
- Hashcode settings affecting deduplication have changed, to update existing findings run:

    `./manage.py dedupe`

If you're using docker:

    docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe

This can take a while depeneding on your instance size. It might possible that new duplicates are detected among existing findings, so make a backup before running!
