description: Disclaimer field renamed/split and removal of `dc-` scripts.
---

[Pull request #10902](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/10902) introduced different kinds of disclaimers within the DefectDojo instance. The original content of the disclaimer was copied to all new fields where it had been used until now (so this change does not require any action on the user's side). However, if users were managing the original disclaimer via API (endpoint `/api/v2/system_settings/1/`, field `disclaimer`), be aware that the fields are now called `disclaimer_notifications` and `disclaimer_reports` (plus there is one additional, previously unused field called `disclaimer_notes`).

In the past, when DefectDojo supported different database and message brokers, `dc-` scripts have been added to simplify start of Dojo stack. As these backends are not supported, mentioned scripts are not needed anymore. From now we recommend to use standard `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) commands as they are described on [README.md](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/README.md) 

But there are no other special instructions for upgrading to 2.43.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.43.0) for the contents of the release.
