[Pull request #10902](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/10902) introduced different kinds of disclaimers within the DefectDojo instance. The original content of the disclaimer was copied to all new fields where it had been used until now (so this change does not require any action on the user's side). However, if users were managing the original disclaimer via API (endpoint `/api/v2/system_settings/1/`, field `disclaimer`), be aware that the fields are now called `disclaimer_notifications` and `disclaimer_reports` (plus there is one additional, previously unused field called `disclaimer_notes`).

But there are no other special instructions for upgrading to 2.43.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.43.0) for the contents of the release.
