Audit log migration
---

As part of the upgrade to django-auditlog 3.x, there is a migration of
existing records from json-text to json. Depending on the number of
LogEntry objects in your database, this migration could take a long time
to fully execute. If you believe this period of time will be disruptive
to your operations, please consult the [migration guide](https://django-auditlog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-version-3)
for making this migration a two step process.

---

For all other instructions for upgrading to 2.43.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.43.0) for the contents of the release.
