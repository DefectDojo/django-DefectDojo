description: Disclaimer field renamed/split and removal of `dc-` scripts.
---

[Pull request #10902](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/10902) introduced different kinds of disclaimers within the DefectDojo instance. The original content of the disclaimer was copied to all new fields where it had been used until now (so this change does not require any action on the user's side). However, if users were managing the original disclaimer via API (endpoint `/api/v2/system_settings/1/`, field `disclaimer`), be aware that the fields are now called `disclaimer_notifications` and `disclaimer_reports` (plus there is one additional, previously unused field called `disclaimer_notes`).

In the past, when DefectDojo supported different database and message brokers, `dc-` scripts have been added to simplify start of Dojo stack. As these backends are not supported, mentioned scripts are not needed anymore. From now we recommend to use standard `docker compose` (or `docker-compose`) commands as they are described on [README.md](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/README.md) 

**Hash Code changes**
The Rusty Hog parser has been [updated](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/11433) to populate more fields. Some of these fields are part of the hash code calculation. To recalculate the hash code and deduplicate existing Rusty Hog findings, please execute the following command:

    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Essex Hog Scan (Rusty Hog Scan)" --hash_code_only`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Essex Hog Scan (Choctaw Hog)" --hash_code_only`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Essex Hog Scan (Duroc Hog)" --hash_code_only`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Essex Hog Scan (Gottingen Hog)" --hash_code_only`
    `docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c "python manage.py dedupe.py --parser "Essex Hog Scan (Essex Hog)" --hash_code_only`

This command has various command line arguments to tweak its behaviour, for example to trigger a run of the deduplication process.
See [dedupe.py](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/dojo/management/commands/dedupe.py) for more information.
