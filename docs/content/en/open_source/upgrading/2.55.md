## Authorization related optimizations

The queries related to authorizations have been optmized. For example retrieving the list of authorized findings for the logged in user.
Some of these are now also cached during that duration of a request. This should have no functional effects and only results in better performance.

Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.55.0) for the contents of the release.
