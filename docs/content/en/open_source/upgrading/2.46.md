### Import / Reimport Statistics Delta

Following a successful import or reimport, a JSON blob for `statistics` is generated to provide the differential of finding activity.
There was a section in the `delta` JSON blob that referred to a key labeled `left untouched`. This value does not comply with REST
norms, and has been renamed to `untouched`. Here is a before and after to make it clear:

Before:

    "statistics": {
        "before": {},
        "delta": {
        "created": {},
        "closed": {},
        "reactivated": {},
        "left untouched": {}
        },
        "after": {}
    }

After:

    "statistics": {
        "before": {},
        "delta": {
        "created": {},
        "closed": {},
        "reactivated": {},
        "untouched": {}
        },
        "after": {}
    }
