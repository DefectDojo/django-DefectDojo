### Tag Formatting Update

Tags can no longer contain the following characters:

- **Commas (,)**
- **Quotations** (both single `'` and double `"`)
- **Spaces**

#### Automatic Migration

To ensure a smooth transition, an automatic migration will be applied to existing tags as follows:

- **Commas** → Replaced with **hyphens (`-`)**
- **Quotations** (single and double) → **Removed**
- **Spaces** → Replaced with **underscores (`_`)**

#### Examples

- `example,tag` → `example-tag`
- `'SingleQuoted'` → `SingleQuoted`
- `"DoubleQuoted"` → `DoubleQuoted`
- `space separated tag` → `space_separated_tag`

#### Why This Change?

This update improves consistency, enhances search capabilities, and aligns with best practices for tag formatting.

#### Recommended Actions

We recommend reviewing your current tags, specifically CI/CD processes before upgrading to ensure they align with the new format.

Following the deployment of these new behaviors, requests sent to the API or through the UI with any of the violations listed above will result in an error, with the details of the error raised in the response.
