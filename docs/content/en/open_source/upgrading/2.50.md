description: Dropped support for time_zone in System settings and merged MobSF parsers
---

To simplify the management of the DefectDojo application, it is not necessary to set the time zone in two places (environmental variables and system settings). From now on, environmental variable is supported.
Please check that the environmental variable `DD_TIME_ZONE` is set based on your satisfaction. Any [TZ identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) is a valid value. Default value is `UTC`.

There are other instructions for upgrading to 2.50.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.50.0) for the contents of the release.

### Merge of MobSF parsers

Mobsfscan Scan" has been merged into the "MobSF Scan" parser. The "Mobsfscan Scan" scan_type has been retained to keep deduplication working for existing Tests, but users are encouraged to move to the "MobSF Scan" scan_type.

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.49.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.49.0) for the contents of the release.
