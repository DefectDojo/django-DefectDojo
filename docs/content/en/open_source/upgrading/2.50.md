To simplify the management of the DefectDojo application, it is not necessary to set the time zone in two places (environmental variables and system settings). From now on, environmental variable is supported.
Please check that the environmental variable `DD_TIME_ZONE` is set based on your satisfaction. Any [TZ identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) is a valid value. Default value is `UTC`.

There are other instructions for upgrading to 2.50.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.50.0) for the contents of the release.
