description: Dropped support for time_zone in System settings and Helm chart changes.

## time_zone changes

To simplify the management of the DefectDojo application, it is not necessary to set the time zone in two places (environmental variables and system settings). From now on, environmental variable is supported.
Please check that the environmental variable `DD_TIME_ZONE` is set based on your satisfaction. Any [TZ identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) is a valid value. Default value is `UTC`.

## Helm Chart Changes

This release introduces several important changes to the Helm chart configuration:

### Breaking changes

#### Volume Management Improvements

- **Streamlined volume configuration**: The existing volume logic has been removed and replaced with more flexible `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` options that provide deployment-agnostic volume management.

> The previous volume implementation prevented mounting projected volumes (such as secret mounts with renamed key names) and per-container volume mounts (like nginx emptyDir when readOnlyRootFs is enforced).
> The new approach resolves these limitations.

#### Moved values

The following Helm chart values have been modified in this release:

- `redis.transportEncryption.enabled` → `redis.tls.enabled` (aligned with upstream Helm chart)
- `redis.scheme` → `redis.sentinel.enabled` (controls deployment mode and aligns with upstream chart)
- `redis.redisServer` → `redisServer` (prevents potential schema conflicts with upstream chart)
- `redis.transportEncryption.params` → `redisParams` (prevents potential schema conflicts with upstream chart)
- `postgresql.postgresServer` → `postgresServer` (prevents potential schema conflicts with upstream chart)

### New features

#### Container and Environment Enhancements

- **Added extraInitContainers support**: Both Celery and Django deployments now support additional init containers through the `extraInitContainers` configuration option.
- **Enhanced probe configuration for Celery**: Added support for customizing liveness, readiness, and startup probes in both Celery beat and worker deployments.
- **Enhanced environment variable management**: All deployments now include `extraEnv` support for adding custom environment variables. For backwards compatibility, `.Values.extraEnv` can be used to inject common environment variables to all workloads.

### Other changes

- **Celery pod annotations**: Now we can add annotations to Celery beat/worker pods separately.
- **Flexible secret deployment**: Added the capability to deploy secrets as regular (non-hooked) resources to address compatibility issues encountered with CI/CD tools (such as ArgoCD).
- **Optional secret references**: Some secret references are now optional, allowing the chart to function even when certain secrets are not created.
- **Fixed secret mounting**: Resolved issues with optional secret mounts and references.
- **Improved code organization**: Minor Helm chart refactoring to enhance readability and maintainability.
