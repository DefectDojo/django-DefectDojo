- See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.15.0
- If you have made changes to JIRA templates or the template config in the JIRA Project config for instances/products/engagements:
The jira template settings introduced in 1.13 have been changed. You now have to select a subfolder instead of a sinlge template file. If you have chosen a non-default template here, you have to reapply that to all products / engagements. Also you have to move your custom templates into the correct subfolder in `dojo/templates/issue-trackers/`.
- Hashcode calculation logic has changed in #4134, #4308 and #4310 to update existing findings run:

    `./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only`

If you're using docker:

`docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only`

This can take a while depending on your instance size.
