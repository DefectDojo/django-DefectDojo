# **Account Settings**


The account settings page has four sections:


* **User Contact** allows you to set your Username, Email Address, First Name and Last Name.
* **Email Accounts** allows you to add additional email addresses to your accounts. Adding an additional email account will send a verification email to the new address.
* **Manage Social Accounts** allows you to connect DefectDojo Cloud to your GitHub or Google credentials, which can be used to log in instead of a username and password.
* **MFA Settings** allow you to add an MFA code to Google Authenticator, 1Password or similar apps. Adding an additional step to your login process is a good proactive step to prevent unauthorized access.
