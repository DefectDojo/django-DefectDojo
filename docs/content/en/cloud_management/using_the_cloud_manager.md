Logging into DefectDojo's Cloud Manager allows you to configure your account settings and manage your subscription with DefectDojo Cloud.



# **New Subscription**


This page allows you to request a new, or additional Cloud instance from DefectDojo. 




# **Manage Subscriptions**


The Subscription Management page shows all of your currently active Cloud instances, and allows you to configure the Firewall settings for each instance.

Once on the **Edit Subscription** page, enter the IP Address, Mask, and Label for the rule you wish to add. If more than one firewall rule is needed, click **Add New Range** to create a new empty rule.

# **Account Settings**


The account settings page has four sections:


* **User Contact** allows you to set your Username, Email Address, First Name and Last Name.
* **Email Accounts** allows you to add additional email addresses to your accounts. Adding an additional email account will send a verification email to the new address.
* **Manage Social Accounts** allows you to connect DefectDojo Cloud to your GitHub or Google credentials, which can be used to log in instead of a username and password.
* **MFA Settings** allow you to add an MFA code to Google Authenticator, 1Password or similar apps. Adding an additional step to your login process is a good proactive step to prevent unauthorized access.

### Add MFA to your login process
