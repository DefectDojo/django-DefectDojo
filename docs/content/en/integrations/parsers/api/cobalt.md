All parsers which using API have common basic configuration step but with different values. Please, [read these steps](../) at first.

In `Tool Configuration`, select `Tool Type` to "Cobalt.io API" and `Authentication Type` "API Key".
Paste your Cobalt.io API token in the `API Key` field and the desired org token in the `Extras` field.

In `Add API Scan Configuration` provide the ID
of the asset from which to import findings in the field `Service key 1`.
The ID can be found at the end of the URL when viewing the asset in your browser.

If you have more than one asset configured, you
must also select which Cobalt.io API Scan Configuratio to use.
