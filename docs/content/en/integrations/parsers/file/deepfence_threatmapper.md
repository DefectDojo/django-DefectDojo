### Sample Scan Data
Sample Threatmapper scans can be found [here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/tree/master/unittests/scans/deepfence_threatmapper). In this link are both .xlsx and .csv listed. They contain the same content, but csv can be read in the Browser, but only xlsx is supported by the parser.
