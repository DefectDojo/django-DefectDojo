OWASP Dependency Check output can be imported in Xml format. This parser ingests the vulnerable dependencies and inherits the suppressions.

* Suppressed vulnerabilities are tagged with the tag: `suppressed`.
* Suppressed vulnerabilities are marked as inactive, but not as mitigated.
* If the suppression is missing any `<notes>` tag, it tags them as `no_suppression_document`.
* Related vulnerable dependencies are tagged with `related` tag.
