title: "Rusty Hog parser"

From: <https://github.com/newrelic/rusty-hog> Import the JSON output.
Rusty Hog is a secret scanner built in Rust for performance, and based on TruffleHog which is written in Python.

DefectDojo currently supports the parsing of the following Rusty Hog JSON outputs:
- Choctaw Hog: Scans for secrets in a Git repository.
- Duroc Hog: Scans for secrets in directories, files, and archives.
- Gottingen Hog: Scans for secrets in a JIRA issue.
- Essex Hog: Scans for secrets in a Confluence page.

RustyHog scans only one target at a time. This is not efficient if you want to scan all targets (e.g. all JIRA tickets) and upload each single report to DefectDojo.
[Rusty-Hog-Wrapper](https://github.com/manuel-sommer/Rusty-Hog-Wrapper) deals with this and scans a whole JIRA Project or Confluence Space, merges the findings into a valid file which can be uploaded to DefectDojo. (This is no official recommendation from DefectDojo, but rather a pointer in a direction on how to use this vulnerability scanner in a more efficient way.)
