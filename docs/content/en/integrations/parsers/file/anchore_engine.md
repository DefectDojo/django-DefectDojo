### File Types
DefectDojo parser accepts a .json file.

Using the [Anchore CLI](https://docs.anchore.com/current/docs/using/cli_usage/images/inspecting_image_content/) is the most reliable way to generate an Anchore report which DefectDojo can parse. When generating a report with the Anchore CLI, please use the following command to ensure complete data: `anchore-cli --json image vuln <image:tag> all`

### Acceptable JSON Format
All properties are strings and are required by the parser.
