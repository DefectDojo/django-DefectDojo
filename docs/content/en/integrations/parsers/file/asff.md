AWS Security Hub consumes, aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes findings from AWS security services and from the third-party product integrations. Security Hub processes these findings using a standard findings format called the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), which eliminates the need for time-consuming data conversion efforts. Then it correlates ingested findings across products to prioritize the most important ones.

Prowler tool can generate this format with option `-M json-asff`.
