IntSights Threat Command is a commercial Threat Intelligence platform that monitors both the open and dark web to identify threats for the Assets you care about (Domain Names, IP addresses, Brand Names, etc.).

##### Manual Import
Use the Export CSV feature in the IntSights Threat Command GUI to create an *IntSights Alerts.csv* file. This CSV
file can then be imported into Defect Dojo.

##### Automated Import

The IntSights `get-complete-alert` API only returns details for a single alert. To automate the process,
individually fetch details for each alert and append to a list. The list is then saved as the value for the key
"Alerts". This JSON object can then be imported into Defect Dojo.

Example:

    {
       "Alerts":[
          {
             "_id":"5c80egf83b4a3900078b6be6",
             "Details":{
