You can either import the findings in .xml or in .fdr file format. </br>
If you import a .fdr file, the parser will look for the file 'audit.fvdl' and analyze it. An extracted example can be found [here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/tree/master/unittests/scans/fortify/audit.fvdl).

### Sample Scan Data
