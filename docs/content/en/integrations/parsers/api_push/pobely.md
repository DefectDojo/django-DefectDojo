Synchronize Probely Plus findings with DefectDojo.

To setup this integration set the DefectDojo URL and API key on the
Integrations page on Probely. Then, select which Product, Engagement,
and, optionally, the Test you want to synchronize to. The API key needs
to belong to a user with write access to the product.

Works with DefectDojo 1.5.x and 1.6.x. Probely also supports non-public
DefectDojo instances.
