With the Google Sheets sync feature, DefectDojo allow the users to
export all the finding details of each test into a separate Google
Spreadsheet. Users can review and edit finding details via Google
Spreadsheets. Also, they can add new notes to findings and edit existing
notes using the Google Spreadsheet. After reviewing and updating the
finding details in the Google Spreadsheet, the user can import (sync)
all the changes done via the Google Spreadsheet into DefectDojo
database.
