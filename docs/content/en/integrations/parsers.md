## Security Tools

### Acunetix Scanner

XML format

### Acunetix 360 Scanner

Vulnerabilities List - JSON report

### Anchore-Engine

JSON vulnerability report generated by anchore-cli tool, using a command
like `anchore-cli --json image vuln <image:tag> all`

### Aqua

JSON report format.

### Anchore Grype

Anchore Grype JSON report format generated with `-o json` option.

{{< highlight bash >}}
grype defectdojo/defectdojo-django:1.13.1 -o json > many_vulns.json
{{< /highlight >}}

### Arachni Scanner

Arachni Web Scanner (https://www.arachni-scanner.com)

Reports are generated with `arachni_reporter` tool this way:

{{< highlight bash >}}
arachni_reporter --reporter 'json' js.com.afr
{{< /highlight >}}

### AppSpider (Rapid7)

Use the VulnerabilitiesSummary.xml file found in the zipped report
download.

### AuditJS (OSSIndex)

AuditJS scanning tool using OSSIndex database and generated with `--json` or `-j` option (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/auditjs>).

{{< highlight bash >}}
auditjs ossi --json > auditjs_report.json
{{< /highlight >}}

### AWS Security Hub

The JSON output from AWS Security Hub exported with the `aws securityhub get-findings` (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/securityhub/get-findings.html>)
command.

### AWS Scout2 Scanner (deprecated)

JS file in scout2-report/inc-awsconfig/aws\_config.js.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
AWS Scout2 Scanner is deprecated and has been replaced with ScoutSuite (https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) upstream.
Please switch to the new parser for ScoutSuite.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
This parser is disactivated by default in releases >= 2.3.1 and will be removed in release >= 3.x.x.
{{% /alert %}}

### AWS Prowler Scanner

Prowler file can be imported as a CSV (`-M csv`) or JSON (`-M json`) file.

### Azure Security Center Recommendations Scan

Azure Security Center recommendations can be exported from the user interface in CSV format.

### Bandit

JSON report format

### Blackduck Hub

2 options:

* Import the zip file as can be created by Blackduck export.
The zip file must contain the security.csv and files.csv in order to
produce findings that bear file locations information.
* Import a single security.csv file. Findings will not have any file location
information.

### Brakeman Scan

Import Brakeman Scanner findings in JSON format.

### Bugcrowd

Import Bugcrowd results in CSV format.

### Bundler-Audit

Import the text output generated with bundle-audit check

### Burp XML

When the Burp report is generated, **the recommended option is Base64
encoding both the request and response fields** - e.g. check the box
that says \"Base64-encode requests and responses\". These fields will be
processed and made available in the \'Finding View\' page.

### Burp Enterprise Scan

Import HTML reports from Burp Enterprise Edition

### Burp GraphQL

Import the JSON data returned from the BurpSuite Enterprise GraphQL API. Append all the
issues returned to a list and save it as the value for the key "Issues". There is no need
to filter duplicates, the parser will automatically combine issues with the same name.

Example:

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "Issues": [
        {
            "issue_type": {
                "name": "Cross-site scripting (reflected)",

                {
                    "response_index": 0,
                    "response_segments": [
                        {
                            "data_html": "HTTP/2 200 OK "
                        },
                        {
                            "highlight_html": "data"
                        },
                        {

### CargoAudit Scan

Import JSON output of cargo-audit scan report <https://crates.io/crates/cargo-audit>

### Checkov Report

Import JSON reports of Infrastructure as Code vulnerabilities.

### Clair Scan

Import JSON reports of Docker image vulnerabilities.

### Clair Klar Scan

Import JSON reports of Docker image vulnerabilities from clair klar
client.

### Cobalt.io Scan

CSV Report

### Cobalt.io API Import

Import findings from the Cobalt.io API - no file required.

Follow these steps to setup API importing:

1.  Configure the Cobalt.io Authentication details by navigating to
    Configuration / Tool Configuration, selecting the Tool Type to "Cobalt.io",
    and Authentication Type "API Key". Paste your Cobalt.io API key in the
    "API Key" field and the desired org token in the "Extras" field.
2.  In the Product settings select "Add API Scan Configuration" and select the
    previously added Cobalt.io Tool Configuration. Provide the ID
    of the asset from which to import findings in the field *Service key 1*.
    The ID can be found at the end of the URL when viewing the asset in your browser.
3.  After this is done, you can import the findings by selecting "Cobalt.io
    API Import" as the scan type. If you have more than one asset configured, you
    must also select which Cobalt.io API Scan Configuratio to use.

### CodeQL

CodeQL can be used to generate a SARIF report, that can be imported into Defect Dojo:

```shell
codeql database analyze db python-security-and-quality.qls --sarif-add-snippets --format=sarif-latest --output=security-extended.sarif
```

The same can be achieved by running the CodeQL GitHub action with the `add-snippet` property set to true.

### Coverity API

Export Coverity API view data in JSON format (`/api/viewContents/issues` endpoint).

Currently these columns are mandatory:
 * `displayType` (`Type` in the UI)
 * `displayImpact` (`Impact` in the UI)
 * `status` (`Status` in the UI)
 * `firstDetected` (`First Detected` in the UI)

Other supported attributes: `cwe`, `displayFile`, `occurrenceCount` and `firstDetected`

### Crashtest Security

Import JSON Report Import XML Report in JUnit Format

### CredScan Report

Import CSV credential scanner reports

### Contrast Scanner

CSV Report

### Checkmarx

- `Checkmarx Scan`, `Checkmarx Scan detailed`: XML report from Checkmarx SAST (source code analysis)
- `Checkmarx OSA`: json report from Checkmarx Open Source Analysis (dependencies analysis)

To generate the OSA report using Checkmarx CLI:
`./runCxConsole.sh OsaScan -v -CxServer <...> -CxToken <..> -projectName <...>  -enableOsa -OsaLocationPath <lib_folder> -OsaJson <output_folder>`

That will generate three files, two of which are needed for defectdojo. Build the file for defectdojo with the jq utility:
`jq -s . CxOSAVulnerabilities.json CxOSALibraries.json`

### Cloudsploit (AquaSecurity)

From: https://github.com/aquasecurity/cloudsploit . Import the JSON output.

### CycloneDX

CycloneDX is a lightweight software bill of materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.

From: https://www.cyclonedx.org/

Example with Anchore Grype:

{{< highlight bash >}}
./grype defectdojo/defectdojo-django:1.13.1 -o cyclonedx > report.xml
{{< /highlight >}}

Example with `cyclonedx-bom` tool:

{{< highlight bash >}}
pip install cyclonedx-bom
cyclonedx-py
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight bash >}}
  Usage:  cyclonedx-py [OPTIONS]
  Options:
    -i <path> - the alternate filename to a frozen requirements.txt
    -o <path> - the bom file to create
    -j        - generate JSON instead of XML
{{< /highlight >}}

### DawnScanner

Import report in JSON generated with -j option

### Dependency Check

OWASP Dependency Check output can be imported in Xml format. This parser ingests the vulnerable dependencies and inherits the suppressions.

* Suppressed vulnerabilities are tagged with the tag: `suppressed`.
* Suppressed vulnerabilities are marked as inactive, but not as mitigated.
* If the suppression is missing any `<notes>` tag, it tags them as `no_suppression_document`.
* Related vulnerable dependencies are tagged with `related` tag.

### Dependency Track

Dependency Track has implemented a DefectDojo integration. Information about
how to configure the integration is documented here:
https://docs.dependencytrack.org/integrations/defectdojo/

Alternatively, the Finding Packaging Format (FPF) from OWASP Dependency Track can be
imported in JSON format. See here for more info on this JSON format:
<https://docs.dependencytrack.org/integrations/file-formats/>

### DrHeader

Import of JSON report from
<https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/DrHeader>

### Dockle Report

Import JSON container image linter reports
<https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle>

### Detect-secrets

Import of JSON report from <https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets>

### Edgescan

Import Edgescan vulnerabilities by JSON file or API - no file required.

Follow these steps to setup API importing:

1.  Configure the Edgescan Authentication details by navigating to
    Configuration / Tool Configuration, selecting the Tool Type to "Edgescan",
    and Authentication Type "API Key". Paste your Edgescan API key in the
    "API Key" field.
2.  In the Product settings select "Add API Scan Configuration" and select the
    previously added Edgescan Tool Configuration. Provide the ID
    of the asset from which to import findings in the field *Service key 1*.
3.  After this is done, you can import the findings by selecting 
    "Edgescan Scan" as the scan type. If you have more than one asset 
    configured, you must also select which Edgescan API Scan Configuration to 
    use.

### ESLint

### HuskyCI Report

Import JSON reports from
[HuskyCI](<https://github.com/globocom/huskyCI>)

### Hydra

Import JSON reports from [THC Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

Hydra can discover weak login credentials on different types of services (e.g. RDP).

As Hydra cannot provide a severity rating (as it doesn't know how severe a weak login is at this scanned service), all imported findings will be rated 'High'.

Sample JSON report:
```json
{
    "errormessages": [
        "[ERROR] Error Message of Something",
        "[ERROR] Another Message",
        "These are very free form"
    ],
    "generator": {
        "built": "2019-03-01 14:44:22",
        "commandline": "hydra -b jsonv1 -o results.json ... ...",
        "jsonoutputversion": "1.00",

### IntSights Report

IntSights Threat Command is a commercial Threat Intelligence platform that monitors both the open and dark web to identify threats for the Assets you care about (Domain Names, IP addresses, Brand Names, etc.).

#### Manual Import
Use the Export CSV feature in the IntSights Threat Command GUI to create an *IntSights Alerts.csv* file. This CSV
file can then be imported into Defect Dojo.

#### Automated Import

The IntSights `get-complete-alert` API only returns details for a single alert. To automate the process,
individually fetch details for each alert and append to a list. The list is then saved as the value for the key
"Alerts". This JSON object can then be imported into Defect Dojo.

Example:

    {
       "Alerts":[
          {
             "_id":"5c80egf83b4a3900078b6be6",

{{< highlight json >}}
{
    "url_endpoint": "https://api.riskrecon.com/v1",
    "api_key": "you-api-key",
    "companies": [
        {
            "name": "Company 1",
            "filters": {
                "domain_name": [],
                "ip_address": ["127.0.0.1"],
                "host_name": ["localhost"],
                "asset_value": [],
                "severity": ["critical", "high"],
                "priority": [],
                "hosting_provider": [],
                "country_name": []
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Company 2",
            "filters": {
                "ip_address": ["0.0.0.0"]
            }
        }

    ],
    "filters": {
        "domain_name": [],
        "ip_address": [],
        "host_name": [],
        "asset_value": [],
        "severity": ["critical"],
        "priority": [],
        "hosting_provider": [],
        "country_name": []
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

-   More than one company finding list can be queried with it\'s own set
    of filters. Company 1 shows all available fitlers, while Company 2
    shows that empty filters need not be present.
-   To query all companies in your Risk Recon instance, simple remove
    the \"companies\" field entirely.
-   If the \"companies\" field is not present, and filtering is still
    requested, the \"filters\" field can be used to filter all findings
    across all companies. It carries the same behavior as the company
    filters. The \"filters\" field is disregarded in the prescense of
    the \"companies\" field.
-   Removing both fields will allow retrieval of all findings in the
    Risk Recon instance.

### Rusty Hog parser

### SARIF

OASIS Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF). SARIF is
supported by many tools. More details about the format here:
<https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=sarif>

{{% alert title="Information" color="info" %}}
SARIF parser customizes the Test_Type with data from the report.
For example, a report with `Dockle` as a driver name will produce a Test with a Test_Type named `Dockle Scan (SARIF)`
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Current implementation is limited and will aggregate all the findings in the SARIF file in one single report.
{{% /alert %}}

### ScoutSuite

### SonarQube Scan (Aggregates findings per cwe, title, description, file\_path.)

SonarQube output file can be imported in HTML format.

To generate the report, see
<https://github.com/soprasteria/sonar-report>

Version: \>= 1.1.0

### SonarQube Scan Detailed (Import all findings from SonarQube html report.)

SonarQube output file can be imported in HTML format.

To generate the report, see
<https://github.com/soprasteria/sonar-report>

Version: \>= 1.1.0

### SonarQube API Import

SonarQube API will be accessed to gather the report. No report file is
required.

Follow these steps to setup the SonarQube API import:

1.  Configure the Sonarqube authentication details by navigating to
    Configuration / Tool Configuration. Note the url must be in the
    format of `https://<sonarqube_host>/api`. Select the tool
    type to be SonarQube. By default the tool will import vulnerabilities issues
    and security hotspots only,
    but additional filters can be setup using the Extras field separated by
    commas (e.g. BUG,VULNERABILITY,CODE_SMELL)
2.  In the Product settings add an API Scan Configuration. *Service key 1* must
    be the SonarQube project key, which can be found by navigating to a specific project and
    selecting the value from the url
    `https://<sonarqube_host>/dashboard?id=key`.
    When you do not provide a SonarQube project key, DefectDojo will
    use the name of the Product as the project key in SonarQube. If you would like to
    import findings from multiple projects, you can specify multiple keys as
    separated API Scan Configuration in the Product settings.
3.  Once all of the settings are made, the SonarQube API Import will be
    able to import all vulnerability information from the SonarQube
    instance. In the import or re-import dialog you can select which API Scan
    Configuration shall be used. If you do not choose
    any, DefectDojo will use the API Scan Configuration of the Product if there is
    only one defined or the SonarQube Tool Configuration if there is only one.

**Note:**: If `https` is used for the SonarQube, the certificate must be
trusted by the DefectDojo instance.
