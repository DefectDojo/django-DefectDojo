This releases fixes a High severity vulnerability for which the details will be disclosed on November 16th in [GHSA-fwg9-752c-qh8w](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/security/advisories/GHSA-fwg9-752c-qh8w)

There is a breaking change in the API for importing and re-importings scans with SonarQube API and Cobalt.io API. The [scan configurations
have been unified](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/5289) and are set now with the attribute `api_scan_configuration`.
The existing configurations for SonarQube API and Cobalt.io API have been migrated.

At the request of pyup.io, we had to remove the parser for Safety scans.
