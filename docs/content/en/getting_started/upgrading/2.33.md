To continue maintaining the most up to date list of parsers, the following actions have been taken:

- Acunetix and Acunetix360 were merged to Acunetix. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert existing Acunetix360 findings into Acunetix findings.

**Breaking Change**

 - If there is any use of the above mentioned Acunetix360 parser in an automated fashion via the import and reimport API endpoints, the `scan-type` parameter needs to be updated accordingly.

For all other changes, check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.33.0) for the contents of the release.
