To continue maintaining the most up to date list of parsers, the following actions have been taken:

- OpenVAS XML and OpenVAS CSV were merged to OpenVAS Parser. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert existing OpenVAS XML and OpenVAS CSV findings into OpenVAS Parser findings.
- Clair Scan and Clair Klar Scan were merged to Clair Scan. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert existing Clair Klar Scan findings to Clair Scan findings.
- Whitesource has been renamed to Mend. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert existing Whitesource findings and tests into Mend findings and tests

**Breaking Change**

 - If there is any use of the above mentioned parsers in automated fashion via the import and reimport API endpoints, the `scan-type` parameter needs to be updated accordingly.
