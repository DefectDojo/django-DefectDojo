To reduce the number of parsers, multiple parsers were merged together:
- OpenVAS XML and OpenVAS CSV were merged to OpenVAS Parser. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert exiting OpenVAS XML and OpenVAS CSV findings into OpenVAS Parser findings.
- Clair Scan and Clair Klar Scan were merged to Clair Scan. There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert exiting Clair Klar Scan findings to Clair Scan findings.

**Breaking Change**
 - If there is any use of the above mentioned parsers in automated fashion via the import and reimport API endpoints, the `scan-type` parameter needs to be updated accordingly.

For all other changes, check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.31.0) for the contents of the release.
