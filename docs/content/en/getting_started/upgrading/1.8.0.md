description: fix buildwatson create_endpoint_status
---
**What\'s New:**

-   See release notes:
    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases>
-   Improved search, which requires an index rebuild
    (<https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/2861>)

This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.
Execute the django command from the defect dojo installation directory:

`./manage.py buildwatson`

If you\'re using docker:

`docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py buildwatson`

This can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of
findings in your instance.

-   **NOTE:**

As a result of a breaking bug revolving around Endpoint\_status objects,
a corrective script will need to be ran after every dynamic scan
imported through either API version.

The script can be found
[here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/dev/dojo/management/commands/create_endpoint_status.py)

`./manage.py create\_endpoint\_status`

If you\'re using docker:

`docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create\_endpoint\_status`

This can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of
findings in your instance.
