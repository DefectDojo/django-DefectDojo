There is a migration from Whitesource parser to the remaned Mend parser. This is a scanner name change only, all functionality and report formats remain the same.

There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert exiting Whitesource findings and tests into Mend findings and tests

**Breaking Change**

 - If there is any use of  Whitesource in automated fashion via the import and reimport API endpoints, the `scan-type` parameter needs to be updated to `Mend Scan`


For all other changes, check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.30.3) for the contents of the release.
