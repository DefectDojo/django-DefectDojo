**Breaking Change**

 - AWS_Scout2 has been removed. This parser was already disactivated by default in releases >= 2.3.1. and has been replaced with ScoutSuite (https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite) upstream. Please switch to ScoutSuite now if you haven't done it yet. 

For all other changes, check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.34.0) for the contents of the release.
