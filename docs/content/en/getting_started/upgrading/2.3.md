There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.3.0.
In 2.3.0 we [changed the default password hashing algorithm to Argon2 (from PBKDF2)](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/5205).
When logging in, exising hashes get replaced by an Argon2 hash. If you want to rehash password without users having to login,
please see the [Django password management docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/passwords/).
The previous password hashing algorithm (PBKDF2) was not unsafe, but we wanted to follow the [OWASP guidelines](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html).
