    <https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases>

**NOTE:**

When upgrading from before 1.9.2, a corrective script may need to be ran

`./manage.py create\_endpoint\_status`

If you\'re using docker:

`docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create\_endpoint\_status`

This can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of
findings in your instance.

-   Search index tweaking index rebuild after upgrade:

This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.
Execute the django command from the defect dojo installation directory:

`./manage.py buildwatson]`

If you\'re using docker:

`docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py buildwatson`

This can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of
findings in your instance.
