---
There is a migration from the legacy Nessus and Nessus WAS parsers to a single Tenable parser. The updated Tenable parser simply merges existing support for Nessus and Nessus WAS without introducing new functionality that could create instability

There is a migration process built into the upgrade that will automatically convert exiting Nessus and Nessus WAS findings and tests into Tenable findings and tests

**Breaking Change**

 - If there is any use of the Nessus or Nessus WAS in automated fashion via the import and reimport API endpoints, the `scan-type` parameter needs to be updated to `Tenable Scan`
 - The default containerized database will now be [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) rather than [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) due to the use of case insensitivity on fields by default
   - It is recommended to update the [database character set and collation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-database.html) to use UTF encoding 
   - If your deployment uses the MySQL containerized database, please see the following updates to run DefectDojo:
     - Use of the helper script "dc-up": `./dc-up.sh mysql-rabbitmq` or `./dc-up.sh mysql-redis`
     - Use of the helper script "dc-up-d": `./dc-up-d.sh mysql-rabbitmq` or `./dc-up-d.sh mysql-redis`
     - Use of Docker Compose directly: `docker compose --profile mysql-rabbitmq --env-file ./docker/environments/mysql-rabbitmq.env up` or `docker compose --profile mysql-redis --env-file ./docker/environments/mysql-redis.env up`

For all other changes, check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.23.0) for the contents of the release.
