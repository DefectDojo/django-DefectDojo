From 2.35.0, DefectDojo is performing integrity check of `settings.dist.py` file. If the user changed this file (in the past or even now) DefectDojo will avoid starting of instance.
Any customization of variables needs to be done via environmental variables or in 'local_settings.py'.
For more information check [Configuration documentation page](https://documentation.defectdojo.com/getting_started/configuration/).

There are no other special instructions for upgrading to 2.35.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.35.0) for the contents of the release.
