**Breaking change for search:** The field `cve` has been removed from the search index for Findings and the Vulnerability Ids have been added to the search index. With this the syntax to search explicitly for vulnerability ids have been changed from `cve:` to `vulnerability_id:`, e.g. `vulnerability_id:CVE-2020-27619`.
