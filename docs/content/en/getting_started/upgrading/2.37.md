**Breaking Change**

Support for MySQL and RabbitMQ was previously deprecated [see discussion post here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/discussions/9690)) and is now being removed

MySQL and RabbitMQ have been removed from the following places:
- Docker Compose files
- Helm Chart
- Unit/Integration CI/CD Tests

There are no other special instructions for upgrading to 2.37.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.36.0) for the contents of the release.
