**Breaking Change**

Previous HELM `values.yaml` file was not following the official HELM best practicies on key naming - [https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#naming-conventions](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#naming-conventions)

The following `snake_case` keys are replaced with `camelCase` keys in the `values.yaml`:

- `site_url` is replaced with `siteUrl`
- `celery.worker.app_settings` block is replaced with `celery.worker.appSettings`. In this block:

  - `pool_type` is replaced with `poolType`
  - `autoscale_min` is replaced with `autoscaleMin`
  - `autoscale_max` is replaced with `autoscaleMax`
  - `prefetch_multiplier` is replaced with `prefetchMultiplier`

- `django.uwsgi.app_settings` block is changed to `django.uwsgi.appSettings`. In this block:

  - `max_fd` is changed to `maxFd`

- `django.uwsgi.enable_debug` is changed to `django.uwsgi.enableDebug`

There are no special instructions for upgrading to 2.38.x. Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.38.0) for the contents of the release.
