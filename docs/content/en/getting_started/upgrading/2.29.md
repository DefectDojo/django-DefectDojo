There are instructions for upgrading to 2.29.0 if you disabled `enable_auditlog` before (read below). Check the [Release Notes](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/2.29.0) for the contents of the release.

**Breaking Change**

Parameter `enable_auditlog` is not possible to set through System settings anymore. If you set this parameter or you need to change it to `False` (to disable audit logging), set environmental variable `DD_ENABLE_AUDITLOG` to `False`.
