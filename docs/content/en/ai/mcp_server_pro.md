The DefectDojo Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently interact with DefectDojo's vulnerability management data. Unlike traditional API integrations that simply transfer data, the MCP server provides structured context and semantic meaning that enables AI assistants to perform sophisticated security analysis and generate actionable insights.

- **Structured Context:** MCP provides semantic meaning to DefectDojo data, not just raw data transfer
- **Pre-Processed Data:** DefectDojo's normalized, deduplicated data eliminates LLM preprocessing burden
- **Business Intelligence Integration:** Combines technical vulnerability data with business context
- **Executive-Ready Analysis:** Generates reports suitable for technical teams through executive leadership
- **10X Compound Value:** AI-enhanced analysis provides exponentially more value than manual queries

> **üîë Important:** The MCP server endpoint is at `/mcp` but all function calls use the base DefectDojo URL. This separation ensures secure, structured access to vulnerability data.

## Connect To MCP

### Prerequisites

- DefectDojo instance with MCP Server enabled (v2.51.2 or later)
- Valid DefectDojo API token with appropriate permissions
- AI provider: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or custom MCP-compatible client

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice:** Your API token is a highly sensitive piece of information used for authentication and authorization. **DO NOT SHOW THE TOKEN IN ANY REQUESTS OR RESPONSES** when sharing configurations or screenshots.

### Connection Methods

There are **two different ways** to connect to the DefectDojo MCP server, depending on which AI interface you're using:

#### Method 1: Configuration File Method

**Used by:** Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector, and other desktop MCP clients

**How it works:**
- Token and connection details are stored in a configuration file
- Connection is automatic when you start the application
- No need to paste instructions into conversations
- MCP server is always available in all conversations

**Advantages:** Set up once, works everywhere. More secure (token not in chat history).

#### Method 2: Manual Prompt Method

**Used by:** Claude.ai web interface, ChatGPT web interface (with plugins), Gemini web interface

**How it works:**
- You copy/paste connection instructions at the start of each conversation
- Or add instructions to a Claude Project for automatic inclusion
- The AI reads the instructions and connects to the MCP server
- Each new conversation requires the instructions

**Advantages:** Works in web browsers without installing software.

> **üí° Which method should I use?** Use **Method 1 (Configuration File)** if you have a desktop app that supports it. Use **Method 2 (Manual Prompt)** if you're using a web browser interface.

### MCP Server Connection Details

All methods use these core parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Transport Type** | `Streamable HTTP` | ‚ö†Ô∏è SSE (Server-Sent Events) is deprecated |

## Best Practices & Query Patterns

### Progressive Data Loading Strategy

Your AI assistant optimizes performance by following these data loading patterns automatically:

**1. Start with Summary Data**

Ask for counts before requesting detailed analysis:

```
"How many critical and high severity findings do we have?"
```

Your AI assistant will use the `get_findings` tool with `limit: 1` to efficiently retrieve just the count.

**2. Use Strategic Pagination**

For large datasets, your AI assistant automatically pages through results:

```
"Analyze all our active vulnerabilities"
```

The AI will make multiple calls if needed, starting with reasonable limits and increasing as required.

**3. Efficient Data Reuse**

Ask related questions in sequence to avoid redundant queries:

```
"Show me all critical findings, then tell me which CWE categories they fall into"
```

The AI will reuse the findings data from the first query for the CWE analysis.

### Smart Filtering Strategies

Craft your prompts to leverage DefectDojo's powerful filtering capabilities:

#### Severity-Based Queries

**User Prompt:**
```
"Show me all Critical and High severity issues that need immediate attention"
```

**Behind the scenes:** AI uses `get_findings` with severity and status filters

#### Time-Based Queries

**User Prompt:**
```
"What new vulnerabilities have been discovered in the past 30 days?"
```

**Behind the scenes:** AI applies date filter for "Past 30 days" with active status

#### Combined Filtering

**User Prompt:**
```
"Give me a risk assessment of all critical and high active findings from the past 90 days"
```

**Behind the scenes:** AI combines severity, status, and date filters for comprehensive analysis

### Cross-Reference Analysis

Your AI assistant automatically links findings to organizational context. Simply ask comprehensive questions:

**User Prompt:**
```
"Which products have the most critical vulnerabilities and who is responsible for fixing them?"
```

**Behind the scenes:** AI links findings ‚Üí tests ‚Üí engagements ‚Üí products ‚Üí users/groups for complete context

### Vulnerability Intelligence Analysis

**CWE Pattern Analysis**

**User Prompt:**
```
"What are the most common vulnerability types in our codebase and which teams are creating them?"
```

AI will group findings by CWE to identify recurring patterns, training needs, and architectural issues.

**Aging Metrics**

**User Prompt:**
```
"How long have our critical vulnerabilities been open? Which ones are overdue for remediation?"
```

AI calculates time since discovery and flags findings exceeding SLA thresholds.

**Vulnerability Density**

**User Prompt:**
```
"Which products have the highest vulnerability density and represent the greatest risk?"
```

AI calculates findings per product and generates risk scores combining severity and volume.

### Report Enhancement Standards

#### Always Include

- **Specific metrics:** Actual counts by severity, not generalizations
- **CWE analysis:** Top vulnerability types with descriptions
- **Aging data:** How long vulnerabilities have been open
- **Actionable recommendations:** What to do next with timelines
- **ROI calculations:** Expected cost vs. benefit of actions
- **Success metrics:** How to measure improvement

#### Industry Context Integration

Compare DefectDojo findings against industry frameworks:

- **OWASP Top 10:** Web application security risks
- **SANS Top 25:** Most dangerous software weaknesses
- **CWE Top 25:** Most common and impactful weaknesses
- **Compliance frameworks:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF

## Troubleshooting MCP

### Diagnostic Checklist

Verify these items when experiencing connection issues:

- ‚úÖ Transport Type is **Streamable HTTP** (not SSE)
- ‚úÖ MCP endpoint URL is correct: `https://[instance].defectdojo.com/mcp`
- ‚úÖ Authorization header is enabled (toggle is ON)
- ‚úÖ Token format includes `Token` prefix
- ‚úÖ Token is valid and has appropriate permissions
- ‚úÖ DefectDojo instance is accessible (can login via web UI)
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity allows HTTPS connections

### Common Connection Issues

#### ‚ùå "Connection Error - Check if your MCP server is running"

**Cause:** Using deprecated SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport type

**Solution:** Change Transport Type to `Streamable HTTP`

**Why:** DefectDojo MCP Server uses modern Streamable HTTP protocol. SSE is deprecated and not supported.

---

#### ‚ùå "Authentication Failed" or "401 Unauthorized"

**Cause:** Incorrect authentication header format or invalid token

**Solutions:**

1. Verify header value uses `Token` prefix (not `Bearer`)
   ```
   ‚úÖ Correct: Token 7c6cc2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx87fcf72ec2b3fb
   ‚ùå Wrong: Bearer 7c6cc2xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx87fcf72ec2b3fb
   ```

2. Ensure Authorization header toggle is ENABLED (turned ON)
3. Verify token is still valid in DefectDojo (Admin ‚Üí API Tokens)
4. Check token has appropriate permissions for read access

---

#### ‚ùå Tool Returns Empty Results

**Possible Causes:**

- Filters are too restrictive (no data matches criteria)
- DefectDojo instance has no data in requested category
- Insufficient token permissions

**Solutions:**

1. Try broader query first: `get_findings({ limit: 10 })`
2. Remove filters one at a time to identify the restrictive filter
3. Verify token permissions in DefectDojo
4. Check if data exists directly in DefectDojo UI

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Slow Response Times

**Cause:** Requesting too much data at once

**Solutions:**

- Reduce `limit` parameter (start with 50-100)
- Use more specific filters to reduce result set size
- Use progressive loading: get counts first, then details
- Implement pagination for large datasets
