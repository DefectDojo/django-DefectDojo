#### Setting up multiple AWS Hub accounts with a Connector

If you manage Security Hub findings for multiple accounts from a centralized administrator account, you will need to
create the IAM user under that account and configure the Connector with it in order to retrieve findings from those
sub-accounts with a single connector configuration. 

"Member" accounts (either invited manually or automatically associated when using AWS Organizations) will be detected by the Discover operation, and Products will be created for each of your account + region pairs based on the administrator account's cross-region aggregation settings. 

See [this
section of the AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/finding-aggregation.html#finding-aggregation-admin-member) about cross-region aggregation with multiple accounts for more information.
* Once you have created your IAM user and assigned it the necessary permissions using an appropriate policy/role, you will
need to generate an access key and provide the "Access Key" and "Secret Key" components in the relevant connector
configuration fields.
* The "Location" field should be populated with the appropriate API endpoint for your region. For example, to retrieve results from the us-east-1 region, you would supply https://securityhub.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
* Note that we rely on Security Hub's cross-region aggregation to pull findings from more than one region. If cross-region aggregation is enabled, you should supply the API endpoint for your "Aggregation Region". Additional linked regions will have ProductRecords created for them in DefectDojo based on your AWS account IDs and the region names.

- **(Beta UI)**  Jira integration in Beta UI now has parity with Legacy UI.  Ability to Push To Jira has been added, and the Jira ticket view has been added to Findings, Engagements, and all other related objects in DefectDojo.
- **(Finding SLAs)**  Added “Mitigated Within SLA” Finding filter, so that users can now count how many Findings were mitigated on time, and how many were not.  Previously, we were only able to filter Findings that were currently violating SLA or not, rather than ones that had historically violated SLA or not.
- **(Metrics)**  “Mitigated Within SLA” simple metric added to Remediation Insights page.
- **(Reports)**  Custom Content text box no longer renders as HTML.
- **(Tools)**  Wiz Parser now supports SCA format.
- **(Tools)**  Fortify now supports a wider range of .fpr files.

## Sept 9, 2024: v2.38.1

- **(Beta UI)**  Clearing a date filter and re-applying it no longer throws a 400 error.
- **(Dashboard)**  Dashboard Tag Filters now work correctly in both legacy and beta UIs.  
- **(MFA)**  When an admin enforced Global MFA on a DefectDojo instance, there was a loop state that could occur with new users attempting to set up their accounts.  This issue has been corrected, and new users can set a password before enabling MFA.
- **(Permissions)**  When a user had permission to edit a Product, but not a Product Type, there was a bug where they were unable to submit an ‘Edit Product’ form (due to interaction with the Product Type). This has been corrected.
- **(Reimport)**  Reimport now correctly records additional vulnerability IDs beyond 1.  In the past, Findings that had more than one Vulnerability ID (a CVE, for example) would have those additional Vulnerability IDs discarded on reimport, so users were potentially losing those additional Vulnerability IDs.
- **(Tools)**  Threat Composer parser added
- **(Tools)**  Legitify parser added
- **(Tools)**  EPSS score / percentile will now be imported from Aquasec files


## Sept 3, 2024: v2.38.0

- **(Filters)**  Filtering Findings by Date now applies the filter as expected.
- **(Filters)**  Sorting by Severity now orders by lowest-highest severity instead of alphabetically
- **(Reimport)**  Reimporting Findings that have been Risk-Accepted no longer changes their status to ‘Mitigated’.
- **(Risk Acceptance)**  Updating the Simple Risk Acceptance or the Full Risk Acceptance flag on a Product now updates the Product as expected.


## Aug 28, 2024: v2.37.3

- **(API)**  New Endpoint: /finding_groups allows you to GET, add Findings to, delete, or otherwise interact with Finding Groups.  <span style="background-color:rgba(242, 86, 29, 0.5)">(Pro)</span>
- **(Beta UI)**  Relative date ranges for Findings have been added to Finding Filters (last 30 days, last 90 days, etc)
- **(Beta UI)**  Bulk Edit / Risk Acceptance / Finding Group actions are now available in beta UI.	
- **(Beta UI)**  Finding Groups are now available in the beta UI.  Selecting multiple Findings allows you to create a Finding Group, provided those Findings are in the same Test.

- **(SLAs)**  “SLA Violation in _ Days” notifications are no longer being sent for unenforced SLAs.

## Aug 7, 2024: v2.37.0

- **(API)**  Created a method to handle simultaneous async reimports to the same Test via API
- **(API)**  Minimum Severity flag now works as expected on /import, /reimport endpoints (Clearsale)

## Jul 8, 2024: v2.36.0

- **(Notifications)**  Improved email notifications with collapsible Finding lists for greater readability
- **(SLAs)**  SLAs can now be optionally enforced.  For each SLA associated with a Product you can set or unset the Enforce __ Finding Days box in the relevant SLA Configuration screen.  When this box is unchecked, SLAs for Findings that match that Severity level will not be tracked or displayed in the UI.
