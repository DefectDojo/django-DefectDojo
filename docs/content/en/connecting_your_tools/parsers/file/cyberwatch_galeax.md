The Cyberwatch (Galeax) Parser is used to import Cyberwatch scan results into DefectDojo. It accepts a JSON input that can be generated by the [Cyberwatch-API-DefectDojo](https://github.com/Galeax/Cyberwatch-API-DefectDojo) tool created by Galeax.

The JSON file should include the following keys:
- **cves**: A list of CVE entries.
- **security_issues**: A list of security issue entries.

For each CVE and security issue found in the JSON input, the parser creates a corresponding finding in DefectDojo.

### Sample Scan Data
