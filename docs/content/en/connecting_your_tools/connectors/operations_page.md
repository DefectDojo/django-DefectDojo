The Operations Page provides an overview of your connector's Discover \& Sync Operations, along with additional details for each. These operations are tracked using a table.



To access a Connector's Operations Page, open **Manage Records \& Operations** for the connector you wish to edit, and then switch to the **\</\> Operations From (tool)** tab.



# The Operations Table


![image](images/operations_page.png)
Each entry on the Operations Table is a record of an operation event, with the following traits:



* **Type** describes whether the event was a **Sync** or a **Discover** operation.
* **Status** describes whether the event ran successfully.
* **Trigger** describes how the event was triggered \- was it a **Scheduled** operation which ran automatically, or a **Manual** operation which was triggered by a DefectDojo user?
* The **Start \& End Time** of each operation is recorded here, along with the **Duration**.
