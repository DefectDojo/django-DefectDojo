To manage expectations, we call this the wishlist. These are items we want to do, are discussing or pondering our minds:
- New modern UI / SPA
- New dashboarding / statistics
- New search engine
- Adopt a plugin framework to allow plugins for issue trackers, parsers, reports, etc
- More flexible model
