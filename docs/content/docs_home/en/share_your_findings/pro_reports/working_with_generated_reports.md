Once you have created one or more **Reports** in DefectDojo you can take further actions, including:

* Using a report as a template for subsequent reports

* Re-running a report with updated data

* Deleting an old or unused report

## Use a report as a Template

DefectDojo allows you to easily create Report templates with your team logo, boilerplate text and a standardized content order.

If you want to change the way a report is set up, or create a new one with a similar layout, you can re\-open the Report Builder by selecting **View Template** from the **⋮** menu next to the report you wish to use as a template.

There are two places where you can find a Report Template to use:

1. From the **Generated Reports** page, where you can see a list of completed reports
2. From the **Report Templates** page, where you can see a list of previously run reports, including reports which were deleted from the **Generated Reports** page.

Both of these pages can be found in the 📄 **Reports** tab on the sidebar.

To access the **Report Templates** page, open 📄**Reports \> Report Templates** from the sidebar. From that table, you can open the report builder by clicking the **⋮** menu next to the report you wish to use as a template.

Every time you make changes to a template or previous report, the result will be saved as a **new** report under Generated Reports so that you don't lose the older version. If you like, the older version can be deleted.

## Re\-Running a Report

DefectDojo Reports are ‘frozen in time’ \- to keep your records consistent, they do not update automatically when DefectDojo experiences data changes.

However, if you want to create an updated version of a previously created report, you can do so by selecting **Re\-run Report** from the **⋮** menu next to the report you wish to generate.

Selecting this option will create a new report in the **Generated Reports** list, with a different **Created** timestamp to indicate that the report was run at a separate time.

## Deleting a Report

If you no longer need a report, you can delete it by selecting **Delete Report** from the **⋮** menu next to the report you wish to delete. Note that this will only remove the report from the **Generated Reports** list \- a record of the report will still exist under **Report Templates** if you want to re\-run it.
