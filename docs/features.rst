Images
    Finding images can now be uploaded to help with documentation and proof of vulnerability.

If you are upgrading from an older version of DefectDojo, you will have to complete the following and make sure
`MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` are properly configured:

Add imagekit to INSTALLED_APPS::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'polymorphic',  # provides admin templates
        'overextends',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.humanize',
        'gunicorn',
        'tastypie',
        'djangobower',
        'auditlog',
        'dojo',
        'tastypie_swagger',
        'watson',
        'tagging',
        'custom_field',
        'imagekit',
    )

Add `r'^media/'` to `LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS`::

    LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS = (
        r'^static/',
        r'^metrics/all$',
        r'^metrics$',
        r'^metrics/product/type/(?P<mtype>\d+)$',
        r'^metrics/simple$',
        r'^api/v1/',
        r'^ajax/v1/',
        r'^reports/cover$',
        r'^finding/image/(?P<token>[^/]+)$'
    )


Then run the following commands (make sure your virtual environment is activated)::

    pip install django-imagekit
    pip install pillow --upgrade
    ./manage.py migrate

New installations will already have finding images configured.

Findings are listed on the ``/finding/open``, ``/finding/closed``, and ``/finding/accepted`` pages. They can be filtered
by their attributes as well as sorted by their Name, Date, Reviewed Date, Severity and Product.

    :alt: Finding View

Automatically Removing Duplicate Findings
    'Deduplication' is a feature that when enabled will compare findings to automatically identify duplicates.
    To enable deduplcation change 'ENABLE_DEDUPLICATION = False' to 'ENABLE_DEDUPLICATION = True' in your
    settings.py file. If you are upgrading from an older version of Dojo simply add 'ENABLE_DEDUPLICATION = True'.

    Dojo deduplicates findings by comparing endpoints, cwe fields, and titles. If a two findings share a URL
    and have the same CWE or title, Dojo marks the less recent finding as a duplicate. When deduplication is enabled, a
    list of deduplicated findings is added to the engagement view.

Metrics
-------

DefectDojo provides a number of metrics visualization in order to help with reporting, awareness and to be able to
quickly communicate a products/product type's security stance.

The following metric views are provided:

Product Type Metrics
    This view provides graphs displaying Open Bug Count by Month, Accepted Bug Count by Month, Open Bug Count by Week,
    Accepted Bug Count by Week as well as tabular data on Top 10 Products by bug severity, Detail Breakdown of all
    reported findings, Opened Findings, Accepted Findings, Closed Findings, Trending Open Bug Count, Trending Accepted
    Bug Count, and Age of Issues.

    .. image:: /_static/met_1.png
        :alt: Product Type Metrics

Product Type Counts
    This view provides tabular data of Total Current Security Bug Count, Total Security Bugs Opened In Period, Total
    Security Bugs Closed In Period, Trending Total Bug Count By Month, Top 10 By Bug Severity, and Open Findings.  This
    view works great for communication with stakeholders as it is a snapshot in time of the product.

    .. image:: /_static/met_2.png
        :alt: Product Type Counts

Simple Metrics
    Provides tabular data for all Product Types.  The data displayed in this view is the total number of S0, S1, S2, S3,
    S4, Opened This Month, and Closed This Month.

    .. image:: /_static/met_3.png
        :alt: Simple Metrics

Engineer Metrics
    Provides graphs displaying information about an testers activity.

    .. image:: /_static/met_4.png
        :alt: Simple Metrics

Metrics Dashboard
    Provides a full screen, auto scroll view with many metrics in graph format.  This view is great for large displays
    or "Dashboards."

    .. image:: /_static/met_5.png
        :alt: Metrics Dashboard

Users
-----

DefectDojo users inherit from `django.contrib.auth.models.User`_.

.. _django.contrib.auth.models.User: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/default/#user-objects

A username, first name, last name, and email address can be associated with each.  Additionally the following
describe the type of use they are:

Active
    Designates whether this user should be treated as active. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts.

Staff status
    Designates whether the user can log into this site.

Superuser status
    Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.

Calendar
--------

The calendar view provides a look at all the engagements occurring during the month displayed.  Each entry is a direct
link to the Engagement view page.

Imports
-------

DefectDojo has the ability to import reports from other security tools.  Currently importers exist for:

1. Burp XML
2. Nessus (CSV, XML)
3. Nmap (XML)
4. Nexpose XML 2.0
5. ZAP XML
6. Veracode Detailed XML Report
7. Checkmarx Detailed XML Report
8. AppSpider Vulnerabilities Summary XML Report (VulnerabilitiesSummary.xml)
9. Arachni Scanner JSON Report
10. Visual Code Grepper XML or CSV
11. OWASP Dependency Check XML
12. Retire.js JavaScript Scan JSON
13. Node Security Platform JSON
14. Qualys XML
15. OpenVAS CSV
16. Snyk JSON
17. Generic Findings in CSV format
18. OWASP SKF


The importers analyze each report and create new Findings for each item reported.  DefectDojo collapses duplicate
Findings by capturing the individual hosts vulnerable.

.. image:: /_static/imp_1.png
    :alt: Import Form

Additionally, DefectDojo allows for re-imports of previously uploaded reports.  DefectDojo will attempt to capture the
deltas between the original and new import and automatically add or mitigate findings as appropriate.

.. image:: /_static/imp_2.png
    :alt: Re-Import Form

Bulk import of findings can be done using a CSV file with the following column headers:

Date: ::
    Date of the finding in mm/dd/yyyy format.

Title: ::
    Title of the finding

CweId: ::
    Cwe identifier, must be an integer value.

Url: ::
    Url associated with the finding.

Severity: ::
    Severity of the finding.  Must be one of Info, Low, Medium, High, or Critical.

Description: ::
    Description of the finding.  Can be multiple lines if enclosed in double quotes.

Mitigation: ::
    Possible Mitigations for the finding.  Can be multiple lines if enclosed in double quotes.

Impact: ::
    Detailed impact of the finding.  Can be multiple lines if enclosed in double quotes.

References: ::
    References associated with the finding.  Can be multiple lines if enclosed in double quotes.

Active: ::
    Indicator if the finding is active.  Must be empty, True or False

Verified: ::
    Indicator if the finding has been verified.  Must be empty, True, or False

FalsePositive: ::
    Indicator if the finding is a false positive.  Must be empty, True, or False

Duplicate: ::
    Indicator if the finding is a duplicate.  Must be empty, True, or False


Port Scans
----------

DefectDojo has the ability to run a port scan using nmap.  Scan can be configured for TCP or UDP ports as well as for
a Weekly, Monthly or Quarterly frequency.

.. image:: /_static/scan_1.png
    :alt: Port Scan Form

In order for the scans to kick off the `dojo.management.commands.run_scan.py` must run.  It is easy to set up a cron
job in order to kick these off at the appropriate frequency.  Below is an example cron entry: ::

    0 0 * * 0 /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Weekly
    0 0 1 * * /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Monthly
    0 0 1 3,6,9,12 * /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Quarterly

.. image:: /_static/scan_2.png
    :alt: Port Scan Form

The scan process will emal the configured recipients with the results.

These scans call also be kicked off on demand by selecting the Launch Scan Now option in the view scan screen.

.. image:: /_static/scan_3.png
    :alt: Port Scan Form

Notifications
-------------

.. image:: /_static/notifications_1.png
    :alt: Notification settings

DefectDojo can inform you of different events in a variety of ways. You can be notified about things like
an upcoming engagement, when someone mentions you in a comment, a scheduled report has finished generating, and more.

The following notification methods currently exist:
- Email
- Slack
- HipChat
- Alerts within DefectDojo

You can set these notifications on a global scope (if you have administrator rights) or on a personal scope. For instance,
an administrator might want notifications of all upcoming engagements sent to a certain Slack channel, whereas an individual user
wants email notifications to be sent to the user's specified email address when a report has finished generating.

In order to identify and notify you about things like upcoming engagements, DefectDojo runs scheduled tasks for this
purpose. These tasks are scheduled and run using Celery beat, so this needs to run for those notifications to work. Instructions
on how to run Celery beat are available in the `Reports`_ section.

Reports
-------

.. image:: /_static/report_1.png
    :alt: Report Listing

DefectDojo's reports can be generated in AsciiDoc and PDF.  AsciiDoc is recommended for reports with a large number of
findings.

The PDF report is generated using `wkhtmltopdf`_ via `Celery`_ and sane defaults are included in the `settings.py` file.
This allows report generation to be asynchronous and improves the user experience.

If you are updating from an older version of DefectDojo, you will need to install `wkhtmltopdf` on your own.  Please
follow the directions for your specific OS in the `wkhtmltopdf documentation`_.

Some operating systems are capable of installing `wkhtmltopdf` from their package managers:

.. Note::
    To get report email notifications, make sure you have a working email configuration in the system settings,
    and enable notifications for generated reports in the notification settings.

Mac: ::

    brew install Caskroom/cask/wkhtmltopdf

Debian/Ubuntu: ::

    sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf

Fedora/Centos: ::

    sudo yum install wkhtmltopdf

.. Warning::
    Version in debian/ubuntu repos have reduced functionality (because it compiled without the wkhtmltopdf QT
    patches), such as adding outlines, headers, footers, TOC etc. To use this options you should install static binary
    from `wkhtmltopdf`_ site or you can use this :download:`script <../reports.sh>`.

Additionally, DefectDojo takes advantage of `python-PDFKit`_ to interact with the `wkhtmltopdf` commandline interface.
It is easily installed by running: ::

    pip install pdfkit

It will also be necessary to add the path of `wkhtmltopdf` to your `settings.py` file.  By default the following entry
ships with DefectDojp: ::

    WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH = '/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf'

However you make have to update that entry to suite your installation.

Celery is included with DefectDojo and needs to be kicked off in order for reports to generate/work.
In development you can run the celery process like: ::

    celery -A dojo worker -l info --concurrency 3

In production it is recommended that the celery process be daemonized.  Supervisor is also included with
DefectDojo and can be set up by following the `Celery documentation`_.  A sample `celeryd.conf` `can be found at`_.

.. _can be found at: https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/3.1/extra/supervisord/celeryd.conf

Celery beat should also be running, this will enable defectDojo to perform periodic checks of things like upcoming and stale engagements
as well as allowing for celery to clean up after itself and keep your task database from
getting too large.  In development you can run the process like: ::

    celery beat -A dojo -l info

In production it is recommended that the celery beat process also be daemonized. A sample `celerybeatd.conf`
`can be found here`_.

.. _can be found here: https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/3.1/extra/supervisord/celerybeat.conf

If you are upgrading from an older version of DefectDojo, you will have to install Celery on your own.  To do this you
you can run: ::

    pip install celery

If you are using virtual environments make sure your environment is activated.  You can also follow the `installation
instructions`_ from the Celery documentation.

.. _wkhtmltopdf: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/
.. _wkhtmltopdf documentation: https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF

.. _Celery documentation: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/daemonizing.html
.. _installation instructions: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/introduction.html#installation

Reports can be generated for:

1.  Groups of Products
2.  Individual Products
3.  Endpoints
4.  Product Types
5.  Custom Reports

.. image:: /_static/report_2.png
    :alt: Report Generation

Filtering is available on all Report Generation views to aid in focusing the report for the appropriate need.

Custom reports allow you to select specific components to be added to the report.  These include:

1.  Cover Page
2.  Table of Contents
3.  WYSIWYG Content
4.  Findings List
5.  Endpoint List
6.  Page Breaks

The custom report workflow takes advantage of the same asynchronous process described above.

JIRA Integration
-------

DefectDojo's JIRA integration is bidirectional. You may push findings to JIRA and share comments. If an issue is closed in JIRA it will automatically be closed in Dojo.


Preparing Jira, Enabling the Webhook
 1. Visit https://<**YOUR JIRA URL**>/plugins/servlet/webhooks
 2. Click 'Create a Webhook'
 3. For the field labeled 'URL' enter: https://<**YOUR DOJO DOMAIN**>/webhook
 4. Under 'Comments' enable 'Created'. Under Issue enable 'Updated'.

Configurations in Dojo
 1. In dojo/settings/settings.py set ENABLE_JIRA = True.

Adding JIRA to Dojo
 1. Click 'JIRA' from the left hand menu.
 2. Select 'Add Configuration' from the drop-down.
 3. To obtain the 'open status key' and 'closed status key' visit https://<**YOUR JIRA URL**>/rest/api/latest/issue/<**ANY VALID ISSUE KEY**>/transitions?expand=transitions.fields
 4. The 'id' for 'Todo' should be filled in as the 'open status key'
 5. The 'id' for 'Done' should be filled in as the 'closed status key'
 6. To obtain 'epic name id' visit: https://<**YOUR JIRA URL**>/secure/admin/ViewCustomFields.jspa
 7. Click on the cog next to 'Epic Name' and select view.
 8. The numeric value for 'epic name id' will be displayed in the URL
 9. **Note**: dojojira uses the same celery functionality as reports. Make sure the celery runner is setup correclty as described: http://defectdojo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#reports

Issue Consolidation
-------

DefectDojo allows users to automatically consolidate issues from multiple scanners to remove duplicates.

To enable this feature, hover over the configuration tab on the left menu and click on system settings. In system settings, click 'Deduplicate findings'. Click 'Submit' at the bottom of the page.


When deduplication is enabled, Dojo will compare CWE, title, and endpoint details for all findings in a given product.
If an issue is added with either the CWE or title being the same while the endpoint is also the same, Dojo marks the old issue as a duplicate.

False Positive Removal
-------

DefectDojo allows users to tune out false positives by enabling False Positive History. This will track what engineers have labeled as false positive for a specific product and for a specific scanner. While enabled, when a tool reports the same issue that has been flagged as a false positive previously, it will automatically mark the finding as a false positive, helping to tune overly verbose security tools.
