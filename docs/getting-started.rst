Getting Started
===============

*Demo*
If you'd like to check out a demo of DefectDojo before installing it, you can check out on our `PythonAnywhere demo site`_.

.. _PythonAnywhere demo site: https://defectdojo.pythonanywhere.com

You can log in as an administrator like so:

You can also log in as a product owner or non-staff user:

*Installation*


Change into the newly created ```django-DefectDojo``` directory:

    ``cd django-DefectDojo/``

There is a script in the main folder called ``setup.bash`` that will allow you to interactively install DefectDojo on any Linux based systems. We do not recommend running DefectDojo as root, but you may do so if you choose.

**You will need:**
* MySQL
* pip

**Recommended**
* virtualenv

1. If you haven't already, run ``mysql_secure_install`` to set a password for your root MySQL user.

2. Create a MySQL user with CREATE priviledges, or use root.

**Run the ``setup.bash`` script**
This script will:

1. Install all the operating system packages needed

2. Prompt for database connection information and create the necessary table

3. Install all python packages needed

4. Either ``makemigrations`` and ``migrate`` or ``syncdb`` depending on Django version installed.

5. Provide you with the commands needed to complete the installation

Install Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the script:

    ``./setup.bash``

During the execution you will be prompted for a few items:

    ``MySQL user (should already exist):``

Enter the user you created or `root` if you used ```mysql_secure_installation```

   ``Password for user:``

Enter the password for the MySQL user you selected.

    ``Database name (should NOT exist):``

Select a name for the DefectDojo database.

**All the packages**
It may take some time for all the `OS` and `python` packages to be installed. As of this writing the packages for this `OS` are:

* gcc
* libssl-dev
* python-dev
* libmysqlclient-dev
* python-pip
* mysql-server
* nodejs-legacy
* npm

And the `python` packages are (listed in `setup.py` as well):

* 'Django==1.8',
* 'MySQL-python==1.2.3',
* 'Pillow==2.3.0',
* 'django-secure==1.0',
* 'django-tastypie==0.12.1',
* 'django-tastypie-swagger',
* 'gunicorn==19.1.1',
* 'python-nmap==0.3.4',
* 'pytz==2013.9',
* 'requests==2.2.1',
* 'wsgiref==0.1.2',
* 'django-filter',
* 'supervisor',
* 'humanize'

After all the components have been installed, the `makemigrations` process will prompt you to create a ``superuser``

    ``You have installed Django's auth system, and don't have any superusers defined.
      Would you like to create one now? (yes/no):``

Answer `yes` and follow the prompts, this will be the user you will use to login to DefectDojo.
#. *(OPTIONAL)* If you haven't already, run `mysql_secure_install` to set a password for your root MySQL user.
#. Edit the settings.py file to modify any other settings that you want to
   change, such as your SMTP server information, which we leave off by default.
#. When you are ready to run DefectDojo, run the server with
        ``./run_dojo.bash``

Vagrant Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


*You will need:*

* Vagrant
* VirtualBox
* Ansible

*Instructions:*

#. Modify the variables in `ansible/vars.yml` to fit your desired configuration
#. Type ``vagrant up`` in the repo's root directory
#. If you have any problems during setup, run ``vagrant provision`` once you've fixed them to continue provisioning the
   server
#. If you need to restart the server, you can simply run ``vagrant provision`` again

By default, the server will run on port 9999, but you can configure this in the ``vars.yaml`` file.

Docker Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three versions of Docker Dojo. The first version is a development / testing version, the second is a docker
compose file with Nginx, MySQL and DefectDojo and the third is a Docker Cloud file for Docker Cloud.

Docker Local Install
*************

*You will need:*

* Latest version of Docker

*Instructions:*

#. Run the docker command to pull the latest version of DefectDojo.
        ``docker run -it -p 8000:8000 appsecpipeline/django-defectdojo bash -c "export LOAD_SAMPLE_DATA=True && bash /django-DefectDojo/docker/docker-startup.bash"``
#. Navigate to: http://localhost:8000 and login with the credentials shown in the terminal.

Docker Compose Install
*************

*You will need:*

* Latest version of Docker
* Latest version Docker Compose

*Instructions:*

#. Clone the `Docker Cloud DefectDojo`_ Repo
        ``git clone https://github.com/aaronweaver/docker-DefectDojo``
#. Change directories into the newly created folder.
        ``cd docker-DefectDojo``
#. Run the setup.bash script which will create a random password for MySQL and Dojo and other setup tasks.
        ``bash setup.bash``
#. Run Docker Compose.
        To run docker-DefectDojo and see the Dojo logs in the terminal, use:
        ``docker-compose up``

        To run docker-DefectDojo and get your terminal prompt back, use:
        ``docker-compose up -d``
#. Navigate to https://localhost and login with the username and password specified in the setup.bash script.
