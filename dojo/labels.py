"""
This module provides centralized access to application text copy. For the time being, this centralization is necessary
as some elements (forms.py, templates) require access to labels from across different model packages.

Each model package that needs to support text copy can provide its own 'labels.py' that can be registered here. That
module should provide a set of stable dictionary keys that can be used to reference text copy within the app, as well as
a dictionary that maps these keys to the text copy.

In this file, the sets of keys and the text copy dictionaries for all such model packages should be imported and added
to the corresponding structures: LabelsProxy should extend the set of keys, and the 'labels' variable should have the
text copy dictionary added to it. The LabelsProxy serves to provide easy autocomplete/linter compatibility with the
full list of text copy keys that exist over the program, until things are more modularized on a per-model basis.

For templates, a `label` context processor has been added, so developers can just use labels.ATTRIBUTE_NAME.

In views/Python code, developers should first import get_labels() and set it to a variable, e.g., labels = get_labels().
Then they can simply use labels.ATTRIBUTE_NAME.

For the stable keys, some conventions used:
    Each copy attribute name starts with a noun representing the overarching model/object type the label is for.
    Attribute suffixes are as follows:
        _LABEL -> short label, used for UI/API fields
        _MESSAGE -> a longer message displayed as a toast or displayed on the page
        _HELP -> helptext (for help_text kwargs/popover content)
