Multi-factor authentication (MFA) was commonly accepted in security circles but rarely required elsewhere. As the number of password breaches increased, the idea that usernames are somehow confidential and passwords unknown, rendered many security controls untenable. For example, NIST 800-63 considers usernames and knowledge based authentication (KBA) as public information, SMS and email notifications as [\"restricted\" authenticator types](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b1) , and passwords as pre-breached. This reality renders knowledge based authenticators, SMS and email recovery, password history, complexity, and rotation controls useless. These controls always have been less than helpful, often forcing users to come up with weak passwords every few months, but with the release of over 5 billion username and password breaches, it's time to move on.\n\nOf all the sections in the ASVS, the authentication and session management chapters have changed the most. Adoption of effective, evidence-based leading practice will be challenging for many, and that's perfectly okay. We have to start the transition to a post-password future now.",

      "objective": "Security architecture has almost become a lost art in many organizations. The days of the enterprise architect have passed in the age of DevSecOps. The application security field must catch up and adopt agile security principles while re-introducing leading security architecture principles to software practitioners. Architecture is not an implementation, but a way of thinking about a problem that has potentially many different answers, and no one single \"correct\" answer. All too often, security is seen as inflexible and demanding that developers fix code in a particular way, when the developers may know a much better way to solve the problem. There is no single, simple solution for architecture, and to pretend otherwise is a disservice to the software engineering field.\n\nA specific implementation of a web application is likely to be revised continuously throughout its lifetime, but the overall architecture will likely rarely change but evolve slowly. Security architecture is identical - we need authentication today, we will require authentication tomorrow, and we will need it five years from now. If we make sound decisions today, we can save a lot of effort, time, and money if we select and re-use architecturally compliant solutions. For example, a decade ago, multifactor authentication was rarely implemented.\n\nIf developers had invested in a single, secure identity provider model, such as SAML federated identity, the identity provider could be updated to incorporate new requirements such as NIST 800-63 compliance, while not changing the interfaces of the original application. If many applications shared the same security architecture and thus that same component, they all benefit from this upgrade at once. However, SAML will not always remain as the best or most suitable authentication solution - it might need to be swapped out for other solutions as requirements change. Changes like this are either complicated, so costly as to necessitate a complete re-write, or outright impossible without security architecture.\n\nIn this chapter, the ASVS covers off the primary aspects of any sound security architecture: availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, non-repudiation, and privacy. Each of these security principles must be built in and be innate to all applications. It is critical to \"shift left\", starting with developer enablement with secure coding checklists, mentoring and training, coding and testing, building, deployment, configuration, and operations, and finishing with follow up independent testing to assure that all of the security controls are present and functional. The last step used to be everything we did as an industry, but that is no longer sufficient when developers push code into production tens or hundreds of times a day. Application security professionals must keep up with agile techniques, which means adopting developer tools, learning to code, and working with developers rather than criticizing the project months after everyone else has moved on.",

This should be differentiated from a simple token containing only an identifier, which a receiving service uses to look up data locally. The most common examples of self-contained tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and SAML assertions.\n\nThe use of self-contained tokens has become very widespread, even outside of OAuth and OIDC. At the same time, the security of this mechanism relies on the ability to validate the integrity of the token and to ensure that the token is valid for a particular context. There are many pitfalls with this process, and this chapter provides specific details of the mechanisms that applications should have in place to prevent them.",

      "name": "V10 OAuth and OIDC",
      "objective": "OAuth2 (referred to as OAuth in this chapter) is an industry-standard framework for delegated authorization. For example, using OAuth, a client application can obtain access to APIs (server resources) on a user's behalf, provided the user has authorized the client application to do so.\n\nBy itself, OAuth is not designed for user authentication. The OpenID Connect (OIDC) framework extends OAuth by adding a user identity layer on top of OAuth. OIDC provides support for features including standardized user information, Single Sign-On (SSO), and session management. As OIDC is an extension of OAuth, the OAuth requirements in this chapter also apply to OIDC.\n\nThe following roles are defined in OAuth:\n\n* The OAuth client is the application that attempts to obtain access to server resources (e.g., by calling an API using the issued access token). The OAuth client is often a server-side application.\n    * A confidential client is a client capable of maintaining the confidentiality of the credentials it uses to authenticate itself with the authorization server.\n    * A public client is not capable of maintaining the confidentiality of credentials for authenticating with the authorization server. Therefore, instead of authenticating itself (e.g., using 'client_id' and 'client_secret' parameters), it only identifies itself (using a 'client_id' parameter).\n* The OAuth resource server (RS) is the server API exposing resources to OAuth clients.\n* The OAuth authorization server (AS) is a server application that issues access tokens to OAuth clients. These access tokens allow OAuth clients to access RS resources, either on behalf of an end-user or on the OAuth client's own behalf. The AS is often a separate application, but (if appropriate) it may be integrated into a suitable RS.\n* The resource owner (RO) is the end-user who authorizes OAuth clients to obtain limited access to resources hosted on the resource server on their behalf. The resource owner consents to this delegated authorization by interacting with the authorization server.\n\nThe following roles are defined in OIDC:\n\n* The relying party (RP) is the client application requesting end-user authentication through the OpenID Provider. It assumes the role of an OAuth client.\n* The OpenID Provider (OP) is an OAuth AS that is capable of authenticating the end-user and provides OIDC claims to an RP. The OP may be the identity provider (IdP), but in federated scenarios, the OP and the identity provider (where the end-user authenticates) may be different server applications.\n\nOAuth and OIDC were initially designed for third-party applications. Today, they are often used by first-party applications as well. However, when used in first-party scenarios, such as authentication and session management, the protocol adds some complexity, which may introduce new security challenges.\n\nOAuth and OIDC can be used for many types of applications, but the focus for ASVS and the requirements in this chapter is on web applications and APIs.\n\nSince OAuth and OIDC can be considered logic on top of web technologies, general requirements from other chapters always apply, and this chapter cannot be taken out of context.\n\nThis chapter addresses best current practices for OAuth2 and OIDC aligned with specifications found at <https://oauth.net/2/> and <https://openid.net/developers/specs/>. Even if RFCs are considered mature, they are updated frequently. Thus, it is important to align with the latest versions when applying the requirements in this chapter. See the references section for more details.\n\nGiven the complexity of the area, it is vitally important for a secure OAuth or OIDC solution to use well-known industry-standard authorization servers and apply the recommended security configuration.\n\nTerminology used in this chapter aligns with OAuth RFCs and OIDC specifications, but note that OIDC terminology is only used for OIDC-specific requirements; otherwise, OAuth terminology is used.\n\nIn the context of OAuth and OIDC, the term \"token\" in this chapter refers to:\n\n* Access tokens, which shall only be consumed by the RS and can either be reference tokens that are validated using introspection or self-contained tokens that are validated using some key material.\n* Refresh tokens, which shall only be consumed by the authorization server that issued the token.\n* OIDC ID Tokens, which shall only be consumed by the client that triggered the authorization flow.\n\nThe risk levels for some of the requirements in this chapter depend on whether the client is a confidential client or regarded as a public client. Since using strong client authentication mitigates many attack vectors, a few requirements might be relaxed when using a confidential client for L1 applications.",

      "objective": "Security logs are distinct from error or performance logs and are used to record security-relevant events such as authentication decisions, access control decisions, and attempts to bypass security controls, such as input validation or business logic validation. Their purpose is to support detection, response, and investigation by providing high-signal, structured data for analysis tools like SIEMs.\n\nLogs should not include sensitive personal data unless legally required, and any logged data must be protected as a high-value asset. Logging must not compromise privacy or system security. Applications must also fail securely, avoiding unnecessary disclosure or disruption.\n\nFor detailed implementation guidance, refer to the OWASP Cheat Sheets in the references section.",

      "objective": "Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) enables real-time voice, video, and data exchange in modern applications. As adoption increases, securing WebRTC infrastructure becomes critical. This section provides security requirements for stakeholders who develop, host, or integrate WebRTC systems.\n\nThe WebRTC market can be broadly categorized into three segments:\n\n1. Product Developers: Proprietary and open-source vendors that create and supply WebRTC products and solutions. Their focus is on developing robust and secure WebRTC technologies that can be used by others.\n\n2. Communication Platforms as a Service (CPaaS): Providers that offer APIs, SDKs, and the necessary infrastructure or platforms to enable WebRTC functionalities. CPaaS providers may use products from the first category or develop their own WebRTC software to offer these services.\n\n3. Service Providers: Organizations that leverage products from product developers or CPaaS providers, or develop their own WebRTC solutions. They create and implement applications for online conferencing, healthcare, e-learning, and other domains where real-time communication is crucial.\n\nThe security requirements outlined here are primarily focused on Product Developers, CPaaS, and Service Providers who:\n\n* Utilize open-source solutions to build their WebRTC applications.\n* Use commercial WebRTC products as part of their infrastructure.\n* Use internally developed WebRTC solutions or integrate various components into a cohesive service offering.\n\nIt is important to note that these security requirements do not apply to developers who exclusively use SDKs and APIs provided by CPaaS vendors. For such developers, the CPaaS providers are typically responsible for most of the underlying security concerns within their platforms, and a generic security standard like ASVS may not fully address their needs.",
