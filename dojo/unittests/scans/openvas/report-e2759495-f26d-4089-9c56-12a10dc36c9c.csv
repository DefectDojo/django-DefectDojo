  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER]. Arcfour (and RC4) has problems
  with weak keys, and should not be used anymore.

  The `none` algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done.
  Note that this method provides no confidentiality protection, and it
  is NOT RECOMMENDED to use it.

  A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext.","Check if remote ssh service supports Arcfour, none or CBC ciphers.
