# Description

![Screenshot of TestTrack](./doc/img/screenshot1.png)

TestTrack is a tool created by the Security Engineering team at Rackspace to
track testing efforts. It attempts to streamline the testing process by
offering features such as templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline
self-service tools. Though it was designed with security folks in mind, there
is nothing keeping QA/QE testers, or any other testers for that matter, from
using it productively.
