# Description

![Screenshot of DefectDojo](./doc/img/screenshot1.png)

DefectDojo is a tool created by the Security Engineering team at Rackspace to
track testing efforts. It attempts to streamline the testing process by
offering features such as templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline
self-service tools. Though it was designed with security folks in mind, there
is nothing keeping QA/QE testers, or any other testers for that matter, from
using it productively.


# Installation

### [Debian or RHEL-based Install Script](./doc/install_bash.md)
Jay has also created a detailed guide for setting up DefectDojo on 
[Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo/wiki/DefectDojo-Installation-Guide---Ubuntu-Desktop-14.04).

### [Vagrant](./doc/install_vagrant.md)

# Getting Started

We recommend checking out the [about](./doc/about.md) document to learn the 
terminology of DefectDojo, and the
[getting started guide](./doc/getting_started.md) for setting up a new
installation. We've also created some example [workflows](./doc/workflows.md)
that should give you an idea of how to use DefectDojo for your own team.
