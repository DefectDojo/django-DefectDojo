# CI/CD Pipeline for My Application

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and configuration for a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## CI/CD Stages
1. **Build**: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
2. **Test**: Runs automated tests using pytest.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to a remote server using SSH.

## Requirements
- GitHub account with Actions enabled.
- Remote server with Docker installed.
- SSH access to the remote server.

## Configuration
1. Add the following secrets in GitHub Actions settings:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`
   - `DEPLOY_SERVER_HOST`
   - `DEPLOY_SERVER_USER`
   - `DEPLOY_SERVER_KEY`
   - `DEPLOY_SERVER_PORT`

2. Ensure that the remote server has Docker installed and is accessible via SSH.

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues
- **Missing `requirements.txt`**: If the `requirements.txt` file is missing, the Safety check will be skipped.
- **Bandit Report Not Found**: Ensure that Bandit generates the `bandit_report.json` file during execution.
- **CodeQL Language Support**: Make sure your project contains Python code for CodeQL analysis.

## Debugging Tips
- Review the logs in the GitHub Actions tab for detailed error messages.
- Ensure all required files (e.g., `requirements.txt`) are present in the repository.
- Update dependencies to fix vulnerabilities reported by Safety.
