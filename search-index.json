This value will not be used only for sending notifications but also for sending the reset password emails. It is highly recommended to check the content of this value if you are satisfied.

The bitnami postgresql chart required us to add a new key to the postgresql secret, which will give you the error postgresql-postgres-password is missing if you have createPostgresqlSecret: false. In 1.10.1, a fix was also included to allow your existing postgresqlPassword to be reused properly.\nIncluding in 1.10.1 were a couple fixes related to a rabbitMQ upgrade. The path to access password, erlangCookie and existingPasswordSecret changed from rabbitmq to auth. Furthermore, as rabbitMQ is deployed as a StatefulSet, an in-place upgrade is not possible and an error will likely be thrown such as Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden. After ensuring your rabbitMQ celery queue is empty, you will then want to delete your rabbitMQ StatefulSet and PVC to allow them to get re-created, or fully delete and recreate defectdojo.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":44,"permalink":"/en/open_source/upgrading/1.10/","summary":"1.10.4 is a security release\nSee the security advisory: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/security/advisories/GHSA-96vq-gqr9-vf2c See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases/tag/1.10.4 Version 1.10.4 replaces 1.10.3 as the latter contained an incomplete fix What's New:","tags":[],"title":"Upgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.10.x"},{"content":"This is a security release\nSee the security advisory See release notes What's New:\nSee release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases NOTE:\nWhen upgrading from before 1.9.2, a corrective script may need to be ran\n./manage.py create\\_endpoint\\_status\nIf you're using docker:\ndocker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create\\_endpoint\\_status\nThis can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of findings in your instance.\nSearch index tweaking index rebuild after upgrade: This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.

DefectDojo collapses duplicate Findings by capturing the individual hosts vulnerable.\nThis approach will create a new Test for each upload. This can result in a lot of findings. If deduplication is enabled, new Findings that are identical to existing Findings get marked as a duplicate.\nReimport Additionally, DefectDojo allows for re-imports of previously uploaded reports. This greatly reduces the amount of findings as no duplicates are created for findings that already exist.\nDefectDojo will attempt to capture the deltas between the original and new import and automatically add or mitigate findings as appropriate.\nThis behaviour can be controled via the closed_old_findings parameter on the reupload form.\nThe history of a test will be shown with the delta\u0026rsquo;s for each reimported scan report. Clicking on a reimport changset will show the affected findings, as well as a status history per finding. Triage-less scanners Some scanners might not include triage information in their reports (e.g. tfsec). They simply scan code or dependencies, flag issues, and return everything. Removing some findings requires you to add comments in your code perhaps, but there is no simple way to filter out findings from the reports.\nThat is why DefectDojo also includes a \u0026ldquo;Do not reactivate\u0026rdquo; checkbox in uploading reports (also in the reimport API), so you can persist the triages that have been done in Defectdojo without reactivating Findings on every upload.\nFor context, see #6892\nAPI This section focuses on Import and Reimport via the API. Please see the full documentation details of all API Endpoints for more details. Reimport is actually the easiest way to get started as it will create any entities on the fly if needed and it will automatically detect if it is a first time upload or a re-upload.\nImport Importing via the API is performed via the import-scan endpoint.\nAs described in the Core Data Classes, a test gets created inside an Engagement, inside a Product, inside a Product Type.\nAn import can be performed by specifying the names of these entities in the API request:\n{ \u0026#34;minimum_severity\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;Info\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;verified\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;scan_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;ZAP Scan\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;test_title\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;Manual ZAP Scan by John\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;product_type_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;Good Products\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;product_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;My little product\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;engagement_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;Important import\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;auto_create_context\u0026#34;: True, }\rWhen auto_create_context is True, the product, engagement, and environment will be created if needed.

Make sure your user has sufficient permissions to do this.\nWhen do_not_reactivate is True, the importing/reimporting will ignore uploaded active findings and not reactivate previously closed findings, while still creating new findings if there are new ones. You will get a note on the finding to explain that it was not reactivated for that reason.\nA reimport will automatically select the latest test inside the provided engagement that satisifes the provided scan_type and (optionally) provided test_title.\nIf no existing Test is found, the reimport endpoint will use the import function to import the provided report into a new Test. This means a (CI/CD) script using the API doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know if a Test already exists, or if it is a first time upload for this Product / Engagement.\nA classic way of reimporting a scan is by specifying the ID of the test instead:\n{ \u0026#34;minimum_severity\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;Info\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;active\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;verified\u0026#34;: True, \u0026#34;scan_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#39;ZAP Scan\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: 123, }\rUsing the Scan Completion Date (API: scan_date) field DefectDojo offers a plethora of supported scanner reports, but not all of them contain the information most important to a user. The scan_date field is a flexible smart feature that allows users to set the completion date of the a given scan report, and have it propagate down to all the findings imported. This field is not mandatory, but the default value for this field is the date of import (whenever the request is processed and a successful response is returned).\nHere are the following use cases for using this field:\nThe report does not set the date, and scan_date is not set at import Finding date will be the default value of scan_date The report sets the date, and the scan_date is not set at import Finding date will be whatever the report sets The report does not set the date, and the scan_date is set at import Finding date will be whatever the user set for scan_date The report sets the date, and the scan_date is set at import Finding date will be whatever the user set for scan_date ","date":"0001-01-01","id":61,"permalink":"/en/open_source/archived_docs/importing/","summary":"Import The importers analyze each report and create new Findings for each item reported.

To have your parser loaded and works correctly, you need to implement the contract.\nyour parser MUST be in a sub-module of module dojo.tools ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser module your parser MUST be a class in this sub-module. ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser.MyToolParser The name of this class MUST be the Python module name without underscores and with Parser suffix. ex: dojo.tools.my_tool.parser.MyToolParser This class MUST have an empty constructor or no constructor This class MUST implement 3 methods: def get_scan_types(self) This function return a list of all the scan_type supported by your parser. This identifiers are used internally. Your parser can support more than one scan_type. For example some parsers use different identifier to modify the behavior of the parser (aggregate, filter, etc\u0026hellip;) def get_label_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): This function return a string used to provide some text in the UI (short label) def get_description_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): This function return a string used to provide some text in the UI (long description) def get_findings(self, file, test) This function return a list of findings If your parser have more than 1 scan_type (for detailled mode) you MUST implement def set_mode(self, mode) method Example:\nclass MyToolParser(object): def get_scan_types(self): return [\u0026#34;My Tool Scan\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My Tool Scan detailed\u0026#34;] def get_label_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): if scan_type == \u0026#34;My Tool Scan\u0026#34;: return \u0026#34;My Tool XML Scan aggregated by ...\u0026#34; else: return \u0026#34;My Tool XML Scan\u0026#34; def get_description_for_scan_types(self, scan_type): return \u0026#34;Aggregates findings per cwe, title, description, file_path.

While we won\u0026rsquo;t remove these connectors, adding API connectors has been problematic and thus we cannot accept new API parsers / connectors from the community at this time for supportability reasonsing. To maintain a high quality API connector, it is necessary to have a license to the tool. To get that license requires partnership with the author or vendor. We\u0026rsquo;re close to announcing a new program to help address this and bring API connectors to DefectDojo.\nTemplate Generator Use the template parser to quickly generate the files required. To get started you will need to install cookiecutter.\n$ pip install cookiecutter Then generate your scanner parser from the root of django-DefectDojo:\n$ cookiecutter https://github.com/DefectDojo/cookiecutter-scanner-parser Read more on the template configuration variables.\nThings to pay attention to Here is a list of considerations that will make the parser robust for both common cases and edge cases.\nDo not parse URLs by hand We use 2 modules to handle endpoints:\nhyperlink dojo.models with a specific class to handle processing around URLs to create endpoints Endpoint. All the existing parser use the same code to parse URL and create endpoints. Using Endpoint.from_uri() is the best way to create endpoints. If you really need to parse an URL, use hyperlink module.\nGood example:\nif \u0026#34;url\u0026#34; in item: endpoint = Endpoint.from_uri(item[\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;]) finding.unsaved_endpoints = [endpoint]\rVery bad example:\nu = urlparse(item[\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;]) endpoint = Endpoint(host=u.host) finding.unsaved_endpoints = [endpoint]\rUse the right libraries to parse information Various file formats are handled through libraries. In order to keep DefectDojo slim and also don\u0026rsquo;t extend the attack surface, keep the number of libraries used minimal and take other parsers as an example.\ndefusedXML in favour of lxml As xml is by default an unsecure format, the information parsed from various xml output has to be parsed in a secure way. Within an evaluation, we determined that defusedXML is the library which we will use in the future to parse xml files in parsers as this library is rated more secure. Thus, we will only accept PRs with the defusedxml library.\nNot all attributes are mandatory Parsers may have many fields, out of which many of them may be optional. It better to not set attribute if you don\u0026rsquo;t have data instead of filling with values like NA, No data etc\u0026hellip;\nCheck class dojo.models.Finding\nData could be missing in the source report Always make sure you include checks to avoid potential KeyError errors (e.g. field does not exist), for those fields you are not absolutely certain will always be in file that will get uploaded. These translate to 500 error, and do not look good.\nGood example:\nif \u0026#34;mykey\u0026#34; in data: finding.cwe = data[\u0026#34;mykey\u0026#34;]\rDo not parse CVSS by hand (vector, score or severity) Data can have CVSS vectors or scores. Don\u0026rsquo;t write your own CVSS score algorithm. For parser, we rely on module cvss.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to use and will make the parser aligned with the rest of the code.\nExample of use:\nfrom cvss.cvss3 import CVSS3 import cvss.parser vectors = cvss.parser.parse_cvss_from_text(\u0026#34;CVSS:3.0/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/E:H/RL:O/RC:R/CR:H/IR:X/AR:X/MAC:H/MPR:X/MUI:X/MC:L/MA:X\u0026#34;) if len(vectors) \u0026gt; 0 and type(vectors[0]) == CVSS3: print(vectors[0].severities()) # this is the 3 severities cvssv3 = vectors[0].clean_vector() severity = vectors[0].severities()[0] vectors[0].compute_base_score() cvssv3_score = vectors[0].scores()[0] print(severity) print(cvssv3_score)\rGood example:\nvectors = cvss.parser.parse_cvss_from_text(item[\u0026#39;cvss_vect\u0026#39;]) if len(vectors) \u0026gt; 0 and type(vectors[0]) == CVSS3: finding.cvss = vectors[0].clean_vector() finding.severity = vectors[0].severities()[0] # if your tool does generate severity\rBad example (DIY):\ndef get_severity(self, cvss, cvss_version=\u0026#34;2.0\u0026#34;): cvss = float(cvss) cvss_version = float(cvss_version[:1]) # If CVSS Version 3 and above if cvss_version \u0026gt;= 3: if cvss \u0026gt; 0 and cvss \u0026lt; 4: return \u0026#34;Low\u0026#34; elif cvss \u0026gt;= 4 and cvss \u0026lt; 7: return \u0026#34;Medium\u0026#34; elif cvss \u0026gt;= 7 and cvss \u0026lt; 9: return \u0026#34;High\u0026#34; elif cvss \u0026gt;= 9: return \u0026#34;Critical\u0026#34; else: return \u0026#34;Informational\u0026#34; # If CVSS Version prior to 3 else: if cvss \u0026gt; 0 and cvss \u0026lt; 4: return \u0026#34;Low\u0026#34; elif cvss \u0026gt;= 4 and cvss \u0026lt; 7: return \u0026#34;Medium\u0026#34; elif cvss \u0026gt;= 7 and cvss \u0026lt;= 10: return \u0026#34;High\u0026#34; else: return \u0026#34;Informational\u0026#34;\rDeduplication algorithm By default a new parser uses the \u0026rsquo;legacy\u0026rsquo; deduplication algorithm documented at https://documentation.defectdojo.com/usage/features/#deduplication-algorithms\nPlease use a pre-defined deduplication algorithm where applicable.\nUnit tests Each parser must have unit tests, at least to test for 0 vuln, 1 vuln and many vulns. You can take a look at how other parsers have them for starters. The more quality tests, the better.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to add checks on attributes of findings.

DefectDojo requires storing endpoints in a specific format (which follow RFCs). Endpoints that do not follow this format can be stored but they will be marked as broken (red flag 🚩in UI). To be sure your parse store endpoints in the correct format run the .clean() function for all endpoints in unit tests\nfindings = parser.get_findings(testfile, Test()) for finding in findings: for endpoint in finding.unsaved_endpoints: endpoint.clean()\rTests API Parsers Not only parser but also importer should be tested. patch method from unittest.mock is usualy usefull for simulating API responses. It is highly recommeded to use it.\nOther files that could be involved Change to the model In the event where you\u0026rsquo;d have to change the model, e.g. to increase a database column size to accomodate a longer string of data to be saved\nChange what you need in dojo/models.py\nCreate a new migration file in dojo/db_migrations by running and including as part of your PR\n$ docker compose exec uwsgi bash -c \u0026#39;python manage.py makemigrations -v2\u0026#39; Accept a different type of file to upload If you want to be able to accept a new type of file for your parser, take a look at dojo/forms.py around line 436 (at the time of this writing) or locate the 2 places (for import and re-import) where you find the string attrs={\u0026quot;accept\u0026quot;:.\nFormats currently accepted: .xml, .csv, .nessus, .json, .html, .js, .zip.\nA need for more than just the parser.py Of course, nothing prevents you from having more files than the parser.py file.

Connectors are designed to get your security tools connected and importing data to DefectDojo as quickly as possible.\nWe currently support Connectors for the following tools, with more on the way:\nAWS Security Hub BurpSuite Checkmarx ONE Dependency-Track Probely Semgrep SonarQube Snyk Tenable These Connectors provide an API-speed integration with DefectDojo, and can be used to automatically ingest and organize vulnerability data from the tool.\nConnectors Quick-Start If you\u0026rsquo;re using DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Auto-Map settings, you can have your first Connector up and running in no time.\nSet up a Connector from a supported tool. Discover your tool\u0026rsquo;s data hierarchy. Sync the vulnerabilities found with your tool into DefectDojo. That\u0026rsquo;s all, really! And remember, even if you create your Connector the \u0026rsquo;easy\u0026rsquo; way, you can easily change the way things are set up later, without losing any of your work.\nHow Connectors Work As long as you have the API key from the tool you\u0026rsquo;re trying to connect, a connector can be added in just a few minutes. Once the connection is working, DefectDojo will Discover your tool\u0026rsquo;s environment to see how you\u0026rsquo;re organizing your scan data.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you have a BurpSuite tool, which is set up to scan five different repositories for vulnerabilities. Your Connector will take note of this organizational structure and set up Records to help you translate those separate repositories into DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Product / Engagement / Test hierarchy. If you have \u0026lsquo;Auto-Map Records\u0026rsquo; enabled, DefectDojo will learn and copy that structure automatically.\nOnce your Record mappings are set up, DefectDojo will start importing scan data on a regular basis. You\u0026rsquo;ll be kept up to date on any new vulnerabilities detected by the tool, and you can start working with existing vulnerabilities immediately, using DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Findings system.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re ready to add more tools to DefectDojo, you can easily rearrange your import mappings to something else. Multiple tools can be set up to import vulnerabilities to the same destination, and you can always reorganize your setup for a better fit without losing any work.\nMy Connector isn\u0026rsquo;t supported Fortunately, DefectDojo can still handle manual import for a wide range of security tools. Please see our Supported Tool List, as well as our guide to Importing data.\nNext Steps Check out the Connectors page by switching to DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Beta UI. Follow our guide to create your first Connector. Check out the process of Discovering \u0026amp; Mapping your security tools and see how they can be configured to import data.

This field is a multiselect field that also has auto completion to make searching and adding existing tags a breeze. Here is what the field looks like on the product from the screenshot in the previous section:\nImport and Reimport\nTags can also be applied to a given test at the time of import or reimport. This is a very handy use case when importing via the API with automation as it provides an opportunity to append automation run details and tool information that may not be captured in the test or finding object directly.\nThe field looks and behaves exactly as it does on a given object\nBulk Edit Menu (Findings only)\nWhen needing to update many findings with the same set of tags, the bulk edit menu can be used to ease the burden.\nIn the following example, lets say I want to update the tags of the two findings with the tag \u0026ldquo;tag-group-alpha\u0026rdquo; to be a new tag list like this [\u0026ldquo;tag-group-charlie\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;tag-group-delta\u0026rdquo;]. First I would select the tags to be updated:\nOnce a finding is selected, a new button appears with the name \u0026ldquo;Bulk Edit\u0026rdquo;. Clicking this button produces a dropdown menu with many options, but the focus is just on tags for now. Update the field to have the desired tag list as follows, and click submit\nThe tags on the selected Findings will be updated to whatever was specified in the tags field within the bulk edit menu\nFiltering Tags can be filtered in many ways through both the UI and the API. For example, here is a snippet of the Finding filters:\nThere are ten fields related to tags:\nTags: filter on any tags that are attached to a given Finding Examples: Finding will be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; Finding Will not be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; Not Tags: filter on any tags that are not attached to a given Finding Examples: Finding will be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; Finding Will not be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; Tag Name Contains: filter on any tags that contain part or all of the query in the given Finding Examples: Finding will be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;Alpha\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Charlie\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;et\u0026rdquo; (part of \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;) Finding Will not be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;Alpha\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Charlie\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;meg\u0026rdquo; (part of \u0026ldquo;Omega\u0026rdquo;) Not Tags: filter on any tags that do not contain part or all of the query in the given Finding Examples: Finding will be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;Alpha\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Charlie\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;meg\u0026rdquo; (part of \u0026ldquo;Omega\u0026rdquo;) Finding Will not be returned Finding Tags: [\u0026ldquo;Alpha\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Charlie\u0026rdquo;] Filter Query: \u0026ldquo;et\u0026rdquo; (part of \u0026ldquo;Beta\u0026rdquo;) For the other six tag filters, they follow the same rules as \u0026ldquo;Tags\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Not Tags\u0026rdquo; as above, but at different levels in the data model:\nTags (Test): filter on any tags that are attached to the Test of a given Finding is part of Not Tags (Test): filter on any tags that are not attached to the Test of a given Finding is part of Tags (Engagement): filter on any tags that are attached to the Engagement of a given Finding is part of Not Tags (Engagement): filter on any tags that are not attached to the Engagement of a given Finding is part of Tags (Product): filter on any tags that are attached to the Product of a given Finding is part of Not Tags (Product): filter on any tags that are not attached to the Product of a given Finding is part of Tag Inheritance When enabled, tags applied to a given product will automatically be applied to all objects under products in the data model.\nConfiguration Tag Inheritance can be enabled at the following scope levels:\nGlobal Scope Every product system wide will begin applying tags to all children objects This is set within the System Settings Product Scope Only the selected product will begin applying tags to all children objects This is set at the product creation/edit page Behaviors Tags can be added and removed to other objects the same as when tag inheritance is disabled. The only exception to that rule being inherited tags as they cannot be removed from an object. See the following example of adding a tag \u0026ldquo;test_only_tag\u0026rdquo; to the Test object and a tag \u0026ldquo;engagement_only_tag\u0026rdquo; to the Engagement.\nWhen updates are made to the tag list on a product, the same changes are made to all objects within the product asynchronously. The duration of this task directly correlates to the number the objects contained within a finding. If the results are not observed within a reasonable time period, consult the celery worker logs to identify where any problems might have arisen.\nRisk Acceptance Findings cannot always be remediated or addressed for various reasons. A finding 'status' can be change to 'accepted' by doing the following: Findings are accepted in the engagement view. To locate the engagement from the finding click the link to engagement as shown below.\nThen, in the engagement view click the plus icon in the 'Risk Acceptance' box and fill in the details to support the risk acceptance.\nThe engagement view is now updated with the risk.\nThe finding status changes to 'Accepted' with a link to the risk acceptance.\nDeduplication Deduplication is a feature that when enabled will compare findings to automatically identify duplicates. When deduplication is enabled, a list of deduplicated findings is added to the engagement view. The following image illustrates the option deduplication on engagement and deduplication on product level:\nUpon saving a finding, DefectDojo will look at the other findings in the product or the engagement (depending on the configuration) to find duplicates\nWhen a duplicate is found:\nThe newly imported finding takes status: inactive, duplicate An \u0026quot;Original\u0026quot; link is displayed after the finding status, leading to the original finding There are two ways to use the deduplication:\nDeduplicate vulnerabilities in the same build/release. The vulnerabilities may be found by the same scanner (same scanner deduplication) or by different scanners (cross-scanner deduplication). this helps analysis and assessment of the technical debt, especially if using many different scanners; although detecting duplicates across scanners is not trivial as it requires a certain standardization. Track unique vulnerabilities across builds/releases so that DefectDojo knows when it finds a vulnerability that has seen it before. this allows you keep information attached to a given finding in a unique place: all further duplicate findings will point to the original one.\nDeduplication configuration Global configuration The deduplication can be activated in \u0026quot;System Settings\u0026quot; by ticking \u0026quot;Deduplicate findings\u0026quot;.\nAn option to delete duplicates can be found in the same menu, and the maximum number of duplicates to keep for the same finding can be configured.\nEngagement configuration When creating or editing an engagement, the \u0026quot;Deduplication within engagement only\u0026quot; checkbox can be ticked.\nIf activated: Findings are only deduplicated within the same engagement. Findings present in different engagements cannot be duplicates Otherwise: Findings are deduplicated across the whole product Note that currently deduplication does not occur across different products.\nDeduplication algorithms The behavior of the deduplication can be configured for each parser in settings.dist.py (or settings.py after install) by configuring the DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER variable, or via the env variable (useful for Kubernetes deployments) DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER with a JSON string like\n{\u0026#34;ScannerName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;algorithm\u0026#34;}\rThe environment variable will override the settings in settings.dist.py, replacing by matching the keys.\nThe available algorithms are:\nDEDUPE_ALGO_UNIQUE_ID_FROM_TOOL (value for DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER: unique_id_from_tool) The deduplication occurs based on finding.unique_id_from_tool which is a unique technical id existing in the source tool. Few scanners populate this field currently. If you want to use this algorithm, you may need to update the scanner code beforehand. Advantages: If your source tool has a reliable means of tracking a unique vulnerability across scans, this configuration will allow defectDojo to use this ability. Drawbacks: Using this algorithm will not allow cross-scanner deduplication as other tools will have a different technical id. When the tool evolves, it may change the way the unique id is generated. In that case you won't be able to recognise that findings found in previous scans are actually the same as the new findings. DEDUPE_ALGO_HASH_CODE (value for DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER: hash_code) The deduplication occurs based on finding.hash_code. The hash_code itself is configurable for each scanner in parameter HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER. DEDUPE_ALGO_UNIQUE_ID_FROM_TOOL_OR_HASH_CODE (value for DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER: unique_id_from_tool_or_hash_code) A finding is a duplicate with another if they have the same unique_id_from_tool OR the same hash_code. Allows to use both a technical deduplication (based on unique_id_from_tool) for a reliable same-parser deduplication and a functional one (based on hash_code configured on CWE+severity+file_path for example) for cross-parser deduplication DEDUPE_ALGO_LEGACY (value for DD_DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER: legacy) This is algorithm that was in place before the configuration per parser was made possible, and also the default one for backward compatibility reasons. Legacy algorithm basically deduplicates based on: For static scanner: ['title', 'cwe', 'line', 'file_path', 'description'] For dynamic scanner: ['title', 'cwe', 'line', 'file_path', 'description', 'endpoints'] Note that there are some subtleties that may give unexpected results. Switch dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication to debug in settings.py to get more info in case of trouble.\nHash_code computation configuration The hash_code computation can be configured for each parser using the parameter HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER in settings.dist.py, or via the env variable (useful for Kubernetes deployments) DD_HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER with a JSON string like\n{\u0026#34;ScannerName\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;field1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;field2\u0026#34;]}\rThe environment variable will override the settings in settings.dist.py, replacing by matching the keys.\nThe parameter HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS list the fields from finding table that were tested and are known to be working when used as a hash_code. Don't hesitate to enrich this list when required (the code is generic and allows adding new fields by configuration only)\nNote that endpoints isn't a field from finding table but rather a meta value that will trigger a computation based on all the endpoints.\nWhen populating HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER, please respect the order of declaration of the fields: use the same order as in HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS: that will allow cross-scanner deduplication to function because the hash_code is computed as a sha-256 of concatenated values of the configured fields.\nTips:\nIt's advised to use fields that are standardized for a reliable deduplication, especially if aiming at cross-scanner deduplication. For example title and description tend to change when the tools evolve and don't allow cross-scanner deduplication\nGood candidates are cwe or cve Adding the severity will make sure the deduplication won't be to aggressive (there are several families of XSS and sql injection for example, with various severities but the same cwe). Adding the file_path or endpoints is advised too. The parameter HASHCODE_ALLOWS_NULL_CWE will allow switching to legacy algorithm when a null cwe is found for a given finding: this is to avoid getting many duplicates when the tool fails to give a cwe while we are expecting it.\nHashcode generation / regeneration When you change the hashcode configuration, it is needed to regenerated the hashcodes for all findings, or at least those findings found by scanners for which the configuration was updated.\nThis is sometimes also needed after an upgrade to a new DefectDojo version, for example when we made changes to the hashcode configuration or calculation logic. We will mention this in the upgrade notes.\nTo regenerate the hashcodes, use the dedupe management command:\ndocker compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --hash_code_only This will only regenerated the hashcodes, but will not run any deduplication logic on existing findings. If you want to run deduplication again on existing findings to make sure any duplicates found by the new hashcode config are marked as such, run:\ndocker compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe The deduplication part of this command will run the deduplication for each finding in a celery task. If you want to run the deduplication in the foreground process, use:\ndocker compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py dedupe --dedupe_sync Please note the deduplication process is resource intensive and can take a long time to complete (estimated ~7500 findings per minute when run in the foreground)\nDebugging deduplication There is a specific logger that can be activated in order to have details about the deduplication process : switch dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication to debug in settings.dist.py.\nDeduplication - APIv2 parameters close_old_findings : if true, findings that are not duplicates and that were in the previous scan of the same type (example ZAP) for the same engagement (or product in case of \u0026quot;close_old_findings_product_scope\u0026quot;) and that are not present in the new scan are closed (Inactive, Verified, Mitigated). close_old_findings_product_scope : if true, close_old_findings applies to all findings of the same type in the product. Note that \u0026quot;Deduplication on engagement\u0026quot; is no longer used to determine the scope of close_old_findings. Deduplication / Similar findings Similar Findings Visualization:\nSimilar Findings While viewing a finding, similar findings within the same product are listed along with buttons to mark one finding a duplicate of the other. Clicking the \u0026quot;Use as original\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as the original while marking the viewed finding as a duplicate. Clicking the \u0026quot;Mark as duplicate\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as a duplicate of the viewed finding. If a similar finding is already marked as a duplicate, then a \u0026quot;Reset duplicate status\u0026quot; button is shown instead which will remove the duplicate status on that finding along with marking it active again. Service Level Agreement (SLA) DefectDojo allows you to maintain your security SLAs and automatically remind teams whenever a SLA is about to get breached, or is breached.\nTo apply SLAs to Findings, open the System Settings page and check \u0026lsquo;Enable Finding SLAs\u0026rsquo;.\nYou will then need to create one or more SLA Configurations, from the SLA Configuration menu (your-defectdojo.com/sla_config).\nSLA notification configuration There are 3 variables in the system settings that can be set for notifications of SLA breaches. By default notifications are disabled. You can either choose to notify about breaches for findings that are only in \u0026lsquo;Active\u0026rsquo; or for any findings across the instance that are in Active, Verified. Furthermore, it is possible choose to only consider findings that have a JIRA issue linked to them.\nThere are 2 variables in the settings.py file that you can configure, to act on the global behavior.\nSLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH = 3 SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH = 7 The SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH is expressed in days. Whenever a finding's \u0026quot;SLA countdown\u0026quot; (time to remediate) drops to this number, a notification would be sent everyday, as scheduled by the crontab in settings.py, until the day it breaches.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH lets you define in days how long you want to be kept notified about findings that have breached the SLA. Passed that number, notifications will cease.\nBe mindful of performance if you choose to have SLA notifications on non-verified findings, especially if you import a lot of findings through CI in 'active' state.\nWhat notification channels for SLA notifications? You will notice that an extra SLA breach option is now present on the Notification page and also in the Product view.\nSLA notification with JIRA You can choose to also send SLA notification as JIRA comments, if your product is configured with JIRA. You can enable this at the Product level in the Product specific JIRA settings.\nThe Product level JIRA notification configuration takes precendence over the global JIRA notification configuration.\nWhen is the SLA notification job run? The default setup will trigger the SLA notification code at 7:30am on a daily basis, as defined in the settings.py file. You can of course modify this schedule to your context.\n\u0026#39;compute-sla-age-and-notify\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;task\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;dojo.tasks.async_sla_compute_and_notify\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;schedule\u0026#39;: crontab(hour=7, minute=30), } The celery containers are the ones concerned with this configuration. If you suspect things are not working as expected, make sure they have the latest version of your settings.py file.\nYou can of course change this default by modifying that stanza.\nLaunching from the CLI You can also invoke the SLA notification function from the CLI. For example, if run from docker compose:\n$ docker compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c \u0026#39;python manage.py sla_notifications\u0026#39; Reports Instant reports Instant reports can be generated for:\nProduct types Products Engagements Tests List of Findings Endpoints Filtering is available on all report generation views to aid in focusing the report for the appropriate need.\nCustom reports Custom reports, generated with the Report Builder, allow you to select specific components to be added to the report. These include:\nCover Page Table of Contents WYSIWYG Content Findings Vulnerable Endpoints Page Breaks DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s reports can be generated in HTML.\nMetrics DefectDojo provides a number of metrics visualization in order to help with reporting, awareness and to be able to quickly communicate a products/product type's security stance.\nThe following metric views are provided:\nProduct Type Metrics This view provides graphs displaying Open Bug Count by Month, Accepted Bug Count by Month, Open Bug Count by Week, Accepted Bug Count by Week as well as tabular data on Top 10 Products by bug severity, Detail Breakdown of all reported findings, Opened Findings, Accepted Findings, Closed Findings, Trending Open Bug Count, Trending Accepted Bug Count, and Age of Issues. Product Type Counts This view provides tabular data of Total Current Security Bug Count, Total Security Bugs Opened In Period, Total Security Bugs Closed In Period, Trending Total Bug Count By Month, Top 10 By Bug Severity, and Open Findings. This view works great for communication with stakeholders as it is a snapshot in time of the product. Product Tag Counts Same as above, but for a group of products sharing a tag. Simple Metrics Provides tabular data for all Product Types. The data displayed in this view is the total number of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, Opened This Month, and Closed This Month. Engineer Metrics Provides graphs displaying information about a tester's activity. Metrics Dashboard Provides a full screen, auto scroll view with many metrics in graph format. This view is great for large displays or \u0026quot;Dashboards.\u0026quot; Users DefectDojo users inherit from django.contrib.auth.models.User.\nA username, first name, last name, and email address can be associated with each user. Additionally the following attributes describe the type of users:\nActive Designates whether this user should be treated as active and can login to DefectDojo. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts. Superuser status Designates that this user can configure the system and has all permissions for objects without explicitly assigning them. A superuser may force a password reset for any user at any given time. This can be set when creating a new user, or when editing an existing one, requiring the user to change their password upon their next login.\nDefectDojo enforces the following password rules for all users:\nMust meet a length requirement of 9 characters Must be unique (not commonly used) Must contain one of each of the following: a number (0-9), uppercase letter (A-Z), lowercase letter (a-z), and symbol ()[]{}|~!@#$%^\u0026amp;*_-+=;:`\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;,\u0026lt;\u0026gt;./? Calendar The calendar view provides a look at all the engagements and tests occurring during the month d, week or day displayed. Each entry is a direct link to the respective engagement or test view page.\nBenchmarks DefectDojo utilizes the OWASP ASVS Benchmarks to benchmark a product to ensure the product meets your application technical security controls. Benchmarks can be defined per the organizations policy for secure development and multiple benchmarks can be applied to a product.\nBenchmarks are available from the Product view. To view the configured benchmarks select the dropdown menu from the right hand drop down menu. You will find the selection near the bottom of the menu entitled: 'OWASP ASVS v.3.1'.\nIn the Benchmarks view for each product, the default level is ASVS Level\nOn the top right hand side the drop down can be changed to the desired ASVS level (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3). The publish checkbox will display the ASVS score on the product page and in the future this will be applied to reporting. On the left hand side the ASVS score is displayed with the desired score, the % of benchmarks passed to achieve the score and the total enabled benchmarks for that AVSV level.\nAdditional benchmarks can be added/updated in the Django admin site. In a future release this will be brought out to the UI.\nEndpoint Meta Importer For heavy infrastructure scanning organizations, endpoints need to be as flexible as possible to get the most of DefectDojo. This flexibility comes in the form of Tags and custom fields. Tags allow users to filter, sort, and report objects in ways the base object is not totally proficient in doing.\nEndpoint Meta Importer provides a means to apply arbitrary tags and custom fields to endpoints in mass via a CSV file. Tags and customs fields are stored in the format of column:row.\nHere is a very simple example with only two columns:\nhostname | team | public_facing ------------------------------------------------------------------ sheets.google.com | data analytics | yes docs.google.com | language processing | yes feedback.internal.google.com | human resources | no\rThe three endpoints hosts will be used to find existing endpoints with matching hosts, or create new endpoints, and then apply meta as follows:\nsheets.google.com (endpoint) -\u0026gt; [ team:data analytics, public_facing:yes ] (tags) docs.google.com (endpoint) -\u0026gt; [ team:language processing, public_facing:yes ] (tags) feedback.internal.google.com (endpoint) -\u0026gt; [ team:human resources, public_facing:no ] (tags)\rEndpoint Meta Importer can be found in the Endpoint tab when viewing a Product\nNote: The field \u0026ldquo;hostname\u0026rdquo; is required as it is used to query/create endpoints.\nFindings Image Upload You can add images (.png, .jpeg, .gif) to your findings. In order to achieve this, you have to click on \u0026ldquo;Manage Files\u0026rdquo; within the finding: There, you can upload a png file to attach it to a finding: The following picture shows the result: ","date":"0001-01-01","id":73,"permalink":"/en/open_source/archived_docs/usage/features/","summary":"Tags In DefectDojo, tags are a first class citizen and are recognized as the facilitators of organization within each level of the data model.","tags":[],"title":"Features"},{"content":"Recommended Options Docker Compose See instructions in DOCKER.md\nSaaS (Includes Support \u0026amp; Supports the Project) SaaS link\nAWS AMI (Supports the Project) Marketplace link, and complete walkthrough\nOptions for the brave (not officially supported) Kubernetes See instructions in KUBERNETES.md\nLocal install with godojo See instructions in README.md in the godojo repository\nCustomizing of settings See Configuration\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":74,"permalink":"/en/open_source/installation/installation/","summary":"Recommended Options Docker Compose See instructions in DOCKER.md\nSaaS (Includes Support \u0026amp; Supports the Project) SaaS link\nAWS AMI (Supports the Project) Marketplace link, and complete walkthrough","tags":[],"title":"Installation"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick reference you can use to ensure successful implementation - from a blank canvas to a fully functional app.\nThe Basics Start by importing a file using the UI.

(note: OS users will need to set up a Product Type and Product before they can import data)\nNow that you have data in DefectDojo, learn more about how to organize it with the Product Hierarchy Overview. The Product Hierarchy creates a working inventory of your apps, which helps you divide your data up into logical categories. These categories can be used to apply access control rules, or to segement your reports to the correct team.\nTry creating a Report to summarize the data you\u0026rsquo;ve imported. Reports can be used to quickly share Findings with stakeholders such as Product Owners.\nThis is the essence of DefectDojo - import security data, organize it, and present it to the folks who need to know.\nAll of these features can be automated, and because DefectDojo can handle over 190 tools (at time of writing) you should be all set to create a functional security inventory of your entire organizational output.\nOther guides Does your organization use Jira?

Upon login with a Google account, a new user will be created if one does not already exist. The criteria for determining whether a user exists is based on the users username. In the event a new user is created, the username is that of the Google address without the domain. Once created, the user creation process will not happen again as the user is recalled by its username, and logged in. In order to make the magic happen, a Google authentication server needs to be created. Closely follow the steps below to guarantee success.\nNavigate to the following address and either create a new account, or login with an existing one: Google Developers Console\nOnce logged in, find the key shaped button labeled Credentials on the left side of the screen. Click Create Credentials, and choose OAuth Client ID:\nSelect Web Applications, and provide a descriptive name for the client.\nAdd the pictured URLs in the Authorized Redirect URLs section. This part is very important. If there are any mistakes here, the authentication client will not authorize the request, and deny access.\nOnce all URLs are added, finish by clicking Create\nNow with the authentication client created, the Client ID and Client Secret Key need to be copied over to the settings. Click the newly created client and copy the values:\nEdit the settings (see Configuration with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_ENABLED=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;**YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;**YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**\u0026#39;), To authorize users you will need to set the following:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_WHITELISTED_DOMAINS = [\u0026#39;example.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;example.org\u0026#39;] or\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_WHITELISTED_EMAILS = [\u0026#39;\u0026lt;email@example.com\u0026gt;\u0026#39;] OKTA In a similar fashion to that of Google, using OKTA as a OAuth2 provider carries the same attributes and a similar procedure. Follow along below.\nNavigate to the following address and either create a new account, or login with an existing one: OKTA Account Creation\nOnce logged in, enter the Applications and click Add Application:\nSelect Web Applications.\nAdd the pictured URLs in the Login Redirect URLs section. This part is very important. If there are any mistakes here, the authentication client will not authorize the request, and deny access. Check the Implicit box as well.\nOnce all URLs are added, finish by clicking Done.\nReturn to the Dashboard to find the Org-URL. Note this value as it will be important in the settings file.\nNow, with the authentication client created, the Client ID and Client Secret Key need to be copied over to the settings. Click the newly created client and copy the values:\nEdit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_ENABLED=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;**YOUR_CLIENT_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;**YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE**\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_OKTA_OAUTH2_API_URL=(str, \u0026#39;https://{your-org-url}/oauth2\u0026#39;), If during the login process you get the following error: The \u0026lsquo;redirect_uri\u0026rsquo; parameter must be an absolute URI that is whitelisted in the client app settings. and the redirect_uri HTTP GET parameter starts with http:// instead of https:// you need to add SOCIAL_AUTH_REDIRECT_IS_HTTPS = True in the settings.\nAzure Active Directory Azure AD Configuration You can now use your corporate Azure Active Directory to authenticate users to Defect Dojo. Users will be using your corporate Azure AD account (A.K.A. Office 365 identity) to authenticate via OAuth, and all the conditional access rules and benefits from Azure Active Directory will also apply to the Defect Dojo Authentication. Once the user signs in, it will try to match the UPN of the user to an existing e-mail from a user in Defect Dojo, and if no match is found, a new user will be created in Defect Dojo, associated with the unique id/value of the user provided by your Azure AD tenant. Then, you can assign roles to this user, such as \u0026lsquo;superuser\u0026rsquo;.\nNavigate to the following address and follow instructions to create a new app registration\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app Once you register an app, take note of the following information:\nApplication (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID Under Certificates \u0026amp; Secrets, create a new Client Secret Under Authentication \u0026gt; Redirect URIs, add a WEB type of uri where the redirect points to\nhttp://localhost:8080/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/ OR https://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/ Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_TENANT_ID=(str, \u0026#39;YOUR_DIRECTORY_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True Restart your Dojo, and you should now see a Login with Azure AD button on the login page which should magically work\nAutomatic Import of User-Groups To import groups from Azure AD users, the following environment variable needs to be set:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_GET_GROUPS=True This will ensure the user is added to all the groups found in the Azure AD Token. Any missing groups will be created in DefectDojo (unless filtered). This group synchronization allows for product access via groups to limit the products a user can interact with.\nThe Azure AD token returned by Azure will also need to be configured to include group IDs. Without this step, the token will not contain any notion of a group, and the mapping process will report that the current user is not a member of any groups. To update the the format of the token, add a group claim that applies to whatever group type you are using. If unsure of what type that is, select All Groups. Do not activate Emit groups as role claims within the Azure AD \u0026ldquo;Token configuration\u0026rdquo; page.\nApplication API permissions need to be updated with the Group.Read.All permission so that groups can be read on behalf of the user that has successfully signed in.\nTo limit the amount of groups imported from Azure AD, a regular expression can be used as the following:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_GROUPS_FILTER=\u0026#39;^team-.*\u0026#39; # or \u0026#39;teamA|teamB|groupC\u0026#39; Automatic Cleanup of User-Groups To prevent authorization creep, old Azure AD groups a user is not having anymore can be deleted with the following environment parameter:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_CLEANUP_GROUPS=True When a user is removed from a given group in Azure AD, they will also be removed from the corresponding group in DefectDojo. If there is a group in DefectDojo, that no longer has any members, it will be left as is for record purposes.\nGitlab In a similar fashion to that of Google and OKTA, using Gitlab as a OAuth2 provider carries the same attributes and a similar procedure. Follow along below.\nNavigate to your Gitlab settings page and got to the Applications section\nhttps://gitlab.com/profile/applications OR https://the_hostname_you_have_gitlab_deployed:your_gitlab_port/profile/applications Choose a name for your application\nFor the Redirect URI, enter the DefectDojo URL with the following format\nhttps://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/gitlab/ Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;YOUR_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_API_URL=(str, \u0026#39;https://gitlab.com\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True Additionally, if you want to import your Gitlab projects as DefectDojo products, add the following line to your settings:\nDD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_PROJECT_AUTO_IMPORT = True Important: if you enable this setting on already working instance with gitlab integrations, it will require new grant \u0026ldquo;read_repository\u0026rdquo; by user\nRestart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with Gitlab button on the login page.\nKeycloak There is also an option to use Keycloak as OAuth2 provider in order to authenticate users to Defect Dojo, also by using the social-auth plugin.\nHere are suggestion on how to configure Keycloak and DefectDojo:\nConfigure Keycloak (assuming you already have an existing realm, otherwise create one)\nNavigate to your keycloak realm and add a new client of type openid-connect. Choose a name for the client id and use this value below for DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_KEY). In the client settings: Set access type to confidential Under valid Redirect URIs, add the URI to your defect dojo installation, e.g. \u0026lsquo;https://\u0026lt;YOUR_DD_HOST\u0026gt;/*\u0026rsquo; Under web origins, add the same (or \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo;) Under Fine grained openID connect configuration -\u0026gt; user info signed response algorithm: set to RS256 Under Fine grained openID connect configuration -\u0026gt; request object signature algorithm: set to RS256 -\u0026gt; save these settings in keycloak (hit save button) Under Scope -\u0026gt; Full Scope Allowed set to off Under mappers -\u0026gt; add a custom mapper here: Name: aud Mapper type: audience Included audience: select your client/client-id here Add ID to token: off Add access to token: on Under credentials: copy the secret (and use as DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET below) In your realm settings -\u0026gt; keys: copy the \u0026ldquo;Public key\u0026rdquo; (signing key) (use for DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_KEY below) In your realm settings -\u0026gt; general -\u0026gt; endpoints: look into openId endpoint configuration and look up your authorization and token endpoint (use them below) Configure Defect Dojo Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True, DD_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True, DD_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_OAUTH2_ENABLED=True, DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your realm public key\u0026gt;\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your client id\u0026gt;\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your keycloak client credentials secret\u0026gt;\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_AUTHORIZATION_URL=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your authorization endpoint\u0026gt;\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your token endpoint\u0026gt;\u0026#39;) or, alternatively, for helm configuration, add this to the extraConfig section:\nDD_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE: \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; DD_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE: \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; DD_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT: \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_OAUTH2_ENABLED: \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_KEY: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your realm public key\u0026gt;\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_KEY: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your client id\u0026gt;\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your keycloak client credentials secret\u0026gt;\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_AUTHORIZATION_URL: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your authorization endpoint\u0026gt;\u0026#39; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;your token endpoint\u0026gt;\u0026#39;\rOptionally, you can set DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT in order to customize the login button\u0026rsquo;s text caption.\nGitHub Enterprise Navigate to your GitHub Enterprise Server and follow instructions to create a new OAuth App https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app Choose a name for your application For the Redirect URI, enter the DefectDojo URL with the following format https://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/github-enterprise/ Edit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information: DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_KEY=(str, \u0026#39;GitHub Enterprise OAuth App Client ID\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_SECRET=(str, \u0026#39;GitHub Enterprise OAuth App Client Secret\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_URL=(str, \u0026#39;https://github.\u0026lt;your_company\u0026gt;.com/\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_API_URL=(str, \u0026#39;https://github.\u0026lt;your_company\u0026gt;.com/api/v3/\u0026#39;), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True, Restart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with GitHub Enterprise button on the login page. SAML 2.0 In a similar direction to OAuth, this SAML addition provides a more secure perogative to SSO. For definitions of terms used and more information, see the plugin plugin homepage.\nNavigate to your SAML IdP and find your metadata\nEdit the settings (see Configuration) with the following information:\nDD_SAML2_ENABLED=(bool, **True**), # SAML Login Button Text DD_SAML2_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT=(str, \u0026#39;Login with SAML\u0026#39;), # If the metadata can be accessed from a url, try the DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL=(str, \u0026#39;\u0026lt;https://your_IdP.com/metadata.xml\u0026gt;\u0026#39;), # Otherwise, downlaod a copy of the metadata into an xml file, and # list the path in DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH=(str, \u0026#39;/path/to/your/metadata.xml\u0026#39;), # Fill in DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP to corresponding SAML2 userprofile attributes provided by your IdP DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP=(dict, { # format: SAML attrib:django_user_model \u0026#39;Email\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;UserName\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;username\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Firstname\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;first_name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Lastname\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;last_name\u0026#39; }), # May configure the optional fields NOTE: DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP in k8s can be referenced as extraConfig (e.g. DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP: 'Email'='email', 'Username'='username'...)\nNOTE: DD_SITE_URL might also need to be set depending on the choices you make with the metadata.xml provider. (File versus URL).\nCheckout the SAML section in dojo/dojo/settings/settings.dist.py and verfiy if it fits your requirement. If you need help, take a look at the plugin documentation.\nRestart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with SAML button (default setting of DD_SAML2_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT) on the login page.\nNOTE: In the case when IDP is configured to use self signed (private) certificate, than CA needs to be specified by define environments variable REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE that points to the path of private CA certificate.\nAdvanced Configuration The https://github.com/IdentityPython/djangosaml2 plugin has a lot of options. For details take a look at the plugin documentation. All default options in DefectDojo can overwritten in the local_settings.py. If you want to change the organization name, you can add the following lines:\nif SAML2_ENABLED: SAML_CONFIG[\u0026#39;contact_person\u0026#39;] = [{ \u0026#39;given_name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Extra\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;sur_name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;Example\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;company\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;DefectDojo\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;email_address\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;dummy@defectdojo.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;contact_type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;technical\u0026#39; }] SAML_CONFIG[\u0026#39;organization\u0026#39;] = { \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: [(\u0026#39;DefectDojo\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;en\u0026#39;)], \u0026#39;display_name\u0026#39;: [(\u0026#39;DefectDojo\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;en\u0026#39;)], }, Migration from django-saml2-auth Up to relase 1.15.0 the SAML integration was based on https://github.com/fangli/django-saml2-auth. Which the switch to djangosaml2 some parameters has changed:\nDD_SAML2_ASSERTION_URL: not necessary any more - automatically generated DD_SAML2_DEFAULT_NEXT_URL: not necessary any more - default forwarding from defectdojo is used DD_SAML2_NEW_USER_PROFILE: not possible any more - default profile is used, see User Permissions DD_SAML2_ATTRIBUTES_MAP: Syntax has changed DD_SAML2_CREATE_USER: Default value changed to False, to avoid security breaches RemoteUser This implementation is suitable if the DefectDojo instance is placed behind HTTP Authentication Proxy. Dojo expects that the proxy will perform authentication and pass HTTP requests to the Dojo instance with filled HTTP headers. The proxy should check if an attacker is not trying to add a malicious HTTP header and bypass authentication.\nValues which need to be set:\nDD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_ENABLED - Needs to be set to True DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_USERNAME_HEADER - Name of the header which contains the username DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_EMAIL_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the email DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_FIRSTNAME_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the first name DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_LASTNAME_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the last name DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_HEADER(optional) - Name of the header which contains the comma-separated list of groups; user will be assigned to these groups (missing groups will be created) DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_CLEANUP(optional) - Same as [#automatic-import-of-user-groups](AzureAD implementation) DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_TRUSTED_PROXY - Comma separated list of proxies; Simple IP and CIDR formats are supported DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_LOGIN_ONLY(optional) - Check Django documentation WARNING: There is possible spoofing of headers (for all DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_xxx_HEADER values). Read Warning in Django documentation\nUser Permissions When a new user is created via the social-auth, only the default permissions are active. This means that the newly created user does not have access to add, edit, nor delete anything within DefectDojo. There are two parameters in the System Settings to influence the permissions for newly created users:\nDefault group When both the parameters Default group and Default group role are set, the new user will be a member of the given group with the given role, which will give him the respective permissions.\nGroups from Identity Providers Some Identity Providers are able to send list of groups to which should user belongs. This functionality is implemented only for Identity Providers mentioned below. For all others, we will be more than happy for contribution (hint: functions assign_user_to_groups and cleanup_old_groups_for_user from dojo/pipeline.py might be useful).\nAzure: Check DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_GET_GROUPS and DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_CLEANUP_GROUPS RemoteUser: Check DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_HEADER and DD_AUTH_REMOTEUSER_GROUPS_CLEANUP Login speed-up You can bypass the login form if you are only using SSO/Social authentication for login in by enabling these two environment variables:\nDD_SOCIAL_LOGIN_AUTO_REDIRECT: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_SHOW_LOGIN_FORM: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;\rLogin form fallback If you are using \u0026ldquo;login speed-up\u0026rdquo;, it can be useful to be able to login by the standard way, for example when an admin user needs to log in because of a change of some settings or permissions. This feature is accessible by a visiting the URL \u0026lt;DD_HOST\u0026gt;/login?force_login_form.\nOther Providers In an effort to accommodate as much generality as possible, it was decided to implement OAuth2 with the social-auth ecosystem as it has a library of compatible providers with documentation of implementation. Conveniently, each provider has an identical procedure of managing the authenticated responses and authorizing access within a given application. The only difficulty is creating a new authentication client with a given OAuth2 provider.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":80,"permalink":"/en/open_source/archived_docs/integrations/social-authentication/","summary":"Auth0 In the same way as with other identity providers, it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to leverage Auth0 to authenticate users on DefectDojo.","tags":[],"title":"Authentication via OAuth2/SAML2"},{"content":"Regular releases The DefectDojo team aims to maintain the following cadence:\nMinor releases: at least once a month on the first Monday of the month.

They can change all settings, manage users and have read / write access to all data. Staff users can add Product Types, and have access to data according to their role in a Product or Product Type. Regular users have limited functionality available. They cannot add Product Types but have access to data according to their role in a Product or Product Type Product and Product Type permissions Users can be assigned as members to Products and Product Types, giving them one out of five predefined roles.

Regular users are not allowed to add Product Types, unless they are a Global Owner or Maintainer.\n2) Every user is allowed to edit and delete his own notes.\nThe role of a user within a Product Type is inherited by all Products of that Product Type, unless the user is explicitly defined as a member of a Product with a different role. In that case, if a user doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a certain right for the Product Type, it is then checked if he has the right for the Product.\nA Product Type needs to have at least one owner. The last owner cannot be removed.\nGlobal permissions Users can be assigned a global role in the Edit User dialog. A global role gives a user access to all Product Types and Products, including the underlying data, with permissions according to the respective role.\nA use case for a global role could be the Chief Information Security Officer of a company who needs an overview of all systems. If he gets the global role Reader, he can see the findings for all products and also all metrics.\nSince global roles give users access to all data, only superusers are allowed to edit it.\nGroups If you have a number of users who should all have the same permissions for some Products or Product Types, you can put them together in a group. The group defines the roles for Products and Product Types that are applied to all members of the group.\nThe membership of a group itself has a role that determines what permissions the member has to manage the group:\nReader Maintainer Owner Add Group 1) View Group x x x Remove yourself as a member x x x Manage Group members x x Edit Group x x Add Group member as Owner x Delete Group x 1) Every superuser can add groups.

DefectDojo includes functionality to create new questionnaires with custom questions, open questionnaires to receive responses for certain time periods from insiders or outsiders, and connect questionnaires with new or existing engagements.\nCreating a New Questionnaire To access, create, or modify new/existing questionnaires, navigate to the All Questionnaires dashboard from the sidebar.\nOn the questionnaire dashboard, all existing questionnaires are displayed. To quickly find a questionnaire, the filters may be used to search for snippets within the questionnaire name and/or description, as well as by active/inactive status.\nWhen questionnaires are open for responses, they will be displayed in the General Questionnaires block towards the bottom of the page.\nTo begin the process of creating a new questionnaire, select the Create Questionnaire button located in the top right of the questionnaire dashboard.\nQuestionnaires have a name and description, as well as an activity status, which are initially set on questionnaire creation, but can be modified in the future if necessary. Once these fields are filled in appropriately, the user can create the questionnaire without any questions (by selecting Create Questionnaire), or with questions (by selecting Create Questionnaire and Add Questions).\nTo add questions to a questionnaire, select the dropdown titled Select as many Questions as applicable, which will open all of the existing questions within DefectDojo. Once the desired questions are selected from the list, the dropdown can be closed, and the Update Questionnaire Questions can be selected to save the newly created questionnaire.\nNote: New questions may also be added at the time of questionnaire creation by selecting the plus located next to the questions dropdown.\nCreating New Questions The questions dashboard displays all of the questions that may exist as part of questionnaires within DefectDojo. Similar to questionnaires, to quickly find a question, the filters may be used to search for optional status, or snippets within the question name and/or description. Two types of questions exist within DefectDojo questionnaires: Text Questions and Multiple Choice Questions. To add a new question, select the Create Question button located in the top right of the questions dashboard.\nAdding Text Questions To add a text question (open-ended), fill out the add question form, where:\nType - The type of question being created, in this case Text. Order - The order of a question describes its position in a questionnaire relative to other questions (e.g., an order of 1 will put the question higher than a question with order 4). Optional - When the optional box is checked, a question will not be required in a questionnaire. Question Text - The text that is displayed to prompt a user for their answer (e.g. What is your favorite color?). Adding Multiple Choice Questions Similar to the process of adding a text question, choice questions (non-open-ended) allow the user to pick from a given list of choices. To add a choice question, fill out the add question form, where:\nType - The type of question being created, in this case Choice. Order - The order of a question describes its position in a questionnaire relative to other questions (e.g., an order of 1 will put the question higher than a question with order 4). Optional - When the optional box is checked, a question will not be required in a questionnaire. Multichoice - When the multichoice box is checked, multiple choices from the list of choices may be selected by the user. Answer Choices - The possible answer choices that may be selected by a user. Publishing a Questionnaire Once a questionnaire has been successfully created, it can be published to accept responses. To publish a questionnaire, select the plus located to the right of General Questionnaires.\nThis will prompt for a specific questionnaire to be selected, as well as a date the questionnaire response window should close. The response window sets a due date for recipients. Once these two options have been selected, publish the questionnaire by selecting Add Questionnaire.\nOnce a questionnaire is published, a link to share it can be retrieved by selecting the Share Questionnaire action. To ensure the newly created questionnaire has been constructed as expected, open the share link and view the newly created questionnaire.\nUnassigned Questionnaires When a questionnaire\u0026rsquo;s response window has closed, all of the responses will be saved, and the questionnaire will be listed as an Unassigned Answered Engagement Questionnaire on the DefectDojo dashboard.\nThere are three actions that may be taken when a questionnaire\u0026rsquo;s response window has closed: View Responses, Create Engagement, and Assign User.\nView Questionnaire Responses To view the questionnaire responses, select the View Responses action. All of the responses from the questionnaire will be displayed.\nCreate an Engagement From a Questionnaire To link the questionnaire to a product via an engagement, select the Create Engagement action. Once a product is selected from the dropdown, select Create Engagement. This will link the questionnaire results with a new engagement under the selected product, which can then be given specific details similar to other engagements in DefectDojo, such as Description, Version, Status, Tags, etc.\nTo view a questionnaire at the engagement level, navigate to the engagement linked with the desired questionnaire. Expand the Additional Features menu to reveal a Questionnaires dropdown, which will contain all of the linked questionnaires.\nAssign a Questionnaire to a User To assign a questionnaire to a user, select the Assign User action. This will prompt for a user to be selected from the dropdown of available users. Once a user is selected, assign the questionnaire to the specified user by selecting Assign Questionnaire.\nCreating Questionnaires From Engagements While questionnaires are commonly created from the questionnaire dashboard, they can also be created at the engagement level. To create a new questionnaire from within an engagement, expand the Additional Features dropdown to reveal the Questionnaires dropdown. In the right side header of the Questionnaires dropdown, select the plus to link a new questionnaire.\nOnce prompted, select a questionnaire from the available surveys list to link it with the engagement. If the user wishes to leave a response at the time of linking the questionnaire with the engagement, the Add Questionnaire and Repond option may be selected. To simply link the questionnaire with the engagement, select Add Questionnaire.\nAnonymous Questionnaires Questionnaires, by default, are only accessible by DefectDojo users.

This file can be modified to your needs, rebuild all containers afterwards. There\u0026rsquo;s also a more limited template available, which can be chosen when configuring a JIRA Instance or JIRA Project for a Product or Engagement:\nAny folder added to dojo/templates/issue-trackers/ will be added to the dropdown (after rebuilding/restarting the containers).\nEngagement Epic Mapping If creating an Engagement, ensure to tick \u0026lsquo;Enable engagement epic mapping\u0026rsquo; if desired. This can also be done after engagement creation on the edit engagement page. This will create an \u0026lsquo;Epic\u0026rsquo; type issue within Jira. All findings in the engagement pushed to Jira will have a link to this Epic issue. If Epic Mapping was enabled after associated findings have already been pushed to Jira, simply pushing them again will link the Jira issue to the Epic issue.\nPushing findings Findings can be pushed to Jira in a number of ways:\nWhen importing scanner reports, select \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; to push every single finding in the report to Jira When creating a new finding, select \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; and submit. This will create the finding in DefectDojo and Jira simultaneously If a finding already exist, visit the edit finding page and find the \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; tick box at the bottom When viewing a list of findings, select each relevant tick boxes to the left of the finding, and click the \u0026lsquo;Bulk Edit\u0026rsquo; button at the top. find \u0026lsquo;Push to JIRA\u0026rsquo; at the bottom of the menu Status Sync DefectDojo will try to keep the status in sync with the status in JIRA using the Close and Reopen transition IDs configured for each JIRA instance. This will only work if your workflow in JIRA allows the Close transition to be performed from every status a JIRA issue can be in.\nKnown Issues The Risk Acceptance feature in DefectDojo will (for that reason) not (yet) try to sync statuses. A comment will be pushed to JIRA if a finding is risk accepted or unaccepted. Contributions are welcome to enhance the integration.\nStatus reconciliation Sometimes JIRA is down, or Defect Dojo is down, or there was bug in a webhook. In this case JIRA can become out of sync with Defect Dojo. If this is the case for lots of issues, manual reconciliation might not be feasible. For this scenario there is the management command \u0026lsquo;jira_status_reconciliation\u0026rsquo;.\nusage: manage.py jira_status_reconciliation [-h] [--mode MODE] [--product PRODUCT] [--engagement ENGAGEMENT] [--dryrun] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] Reconcile finding status with JIRA issue status, stdout will contain semicolon seperated CSV results.

For instances with many objects, this could lead to a considerable performance hit. To alleviate this constriction, enable the \u0026ldquo;Filter String Matching Optimization\u0026rdquo; setting in the System Settings to change many filters to only search on names, rather than the objects themselves. This change will save many large queries, and will improve the performance of UI based interactions.\nAsynchronous Import DefectDojo offers an experimental feature to aynschronously import security reports. This feature works in most use cases, but struggles when doing things such as pushing to Jira during the import process. Because Endpoints are still being processed and created even after the import procedure is completed, pushing Findings to Jira can result in incomplete Jira tickets. It is advised to wait until after import has been completed (reaches 100%).\nTo enable this feature, set ASYNC_FINDING_IMPORT to True in local_settings.py\nAsynchronous Delete For larger instances, deleting an object can take minutes for all related objects to be expanded into memory, rendered on the page, and then removing all objects from the database. To combat this issue, two settings can be set in local_settings.py:\nASYNC_OBJECT_DELETE Deleting an object asynchronously changes the way an object is deleted under the hood. By removing the need to expand into memory, a lot of time (and memory) can be saved by offloading the lookups and removals onto celery processes. This process works by starting at the bottom of a given object, and walking the tree upwards rather than downwards. This way, objects can be seperated into buckets, and then deleted.\nDELETE_PREVIEW Previewing all the objects to be deleted takes almost as much time as deleting the objects itself. This is a safety feature intended to warn users of what they are about to delete, as well as educating users of how the delete functionality works by cascade deleting all related objects. With this feature enabled, the user will only see the following text in the delete preview (without any database lookups)\nPreviewing the relationships has been disabled.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":93,"permalink":"/en/open_source/performance/","summary":"Filter String Matching Optimization IN the UI, many of the filters for a given object will also query related objects for an easy visual match of an item to filter on.","tags":[],"title":"Performance Enhancements"},{"content":"If your team requires an on-premise DefectDojo installation, please connect with our Sales team by emailing -\u0026gt; info at defectdojo dot com\r.

This will improve the performance of DefectDojo.\nIn both cases (dedicated DB or containerized), if you are self-hosting, it is recommended that you implement and create periodic backups of your data.\nBackup of Media files Media files for uploaded files, including threat models and risk acceptance, are stored in a docker volume. This volume needs to be backed up regularly.\nInstance size Please read the paragraphs below about key processes tweaks.\nWith a separate database, the minimum recommendations are:\n2 vCPUs 8 GB of RAM 10 GB of disk space (remember, your database is not here -- so what you have for your O/S should do). You could allocate a different disk than your OS's for potential performance improvements. uWSGI By default (except in ptvsd mode for debug purposes), uWSGI will handle 4 concurrent connections.\nBased on your resource settings, you can tweak:\nDD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_PROCESSES for the number of spawned processes. (default 2) DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_THREADS for the number of threads in these processes. (default 2) For example, you may have 4 processes with 6 threads each, yielding 24 concurrent connections.\nCelery worker By default, a single mono-process celery worker is spawned. When storing a large amount of findings, leveraging async functions (like deduplication), or both. Eventually, it is important to adjust these parameters to prevent resource starvation.\nThe following variables can be changed to increase worker performance, while keeping a single celery container.\nDD_CELERY_WORKER_POOL_TYPE will let you switch to prefork. (default solo) When you enable prefork, the variables below have to be used. see the Dockerfile.django-* for in-file references.\nDD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MIN defaults to 2. DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MAX defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER defaults to 128. You can execute the following command to see the configuration:\ndocker compose exec celerybeat bash -c \u0026quot;celery -A dojo inspect stats\u0026quot; and see what is in effect.\nAsynchronous Import Please note: Asynchronous Import is currently an experimental feature. Please exercise caution with this method as results may be inconsistent.\nImport and Re-Import can also be configured to handle uploads asynchronously to aid in processing especially large scans.

You can be notified about things like an upcoming engagement, when someone mentions you in a comment, a scheduled report has finished generating, and more.\nThe following notification methods currently exist:\nEmail Slack Microsoft Teams Webhooks Alerts within DefectDojo (default) You can set these notifications on a global scope (if you have administrator rights) or on a personal scope. For instance, an administrator might want notifications of all upcoming engagements sent to a certain Slack channel, whereas an individual user wants email notifications to be sent to the user's specified email address when a report has finished generating.\nUsers can define notifications on a product level as well, and these settings will be applied only for selected products.\nIn order to identify and notify you about things like upcoming engagements, DefectDojo runs scheduled tasks for this purpose. These tasks are scheduled and run using Celery beat, so this needs to run for those notifications to work.\nDefectDojo allows template to be used, administrator can use this feature to define which notification should be received by newly created users.\nSlack Basic Integration This method will allow DefectDojo to send Global notifications to a Slack channel. It can also send Personal notifications to an individual user\u0026rsquo;s Slackbot.\nTo configure Slack messaging, you will first need to create a new Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps.\nThis app can be created from scratch, or from a JSON manifest which includes all necessary scopes and bot functionality. This manifest can be copied and pasted into the Slack App wizard when you select \u0026lsquo;Build From Manifest\u0026rsquo;.\nJSON Manifest { \u0026#34;_metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;major_version\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minor_version\u0026#34;: 1 }, \u0026#34;display_information\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DefectDojo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Notifications from DefectDojo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;background_color\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#0000AA\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;features\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;bot_user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;display_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DefectDojo Notifications\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;oauth_config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;scopes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;bot\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;chat:write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;chat:write.customize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;chat:write.public\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;incoming-webhook\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;users:read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;users:read.email\u0026#34; ] }, \u0026#34;redirect_urls\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize\u0026#34; ] } }\rChoose the channel where you want to post Global notifications during the \u0026lsquo;Create From Manifest\u0026rsquo; process. Personal notifications will appear in a user\u0026rsquo;s Slackbot if they have their Slack Email Address specified on their user profile.\nScopes The following scopes have to be granted to your Slack App. If the App was created from the JSON Manifest above, these permission scopes will already be set correctly.\nToken The Slack Bot Token needs to be pasted in the DefectDojo System Settings, nested underneath the \u0026lsquo;Enable slack notifications\u0026rsquo; checkbox. This token can be found in the Features / OAuth \u0026amp; Permissions section on the Slack App settings.\nExamples of Slack notifications Microsoft Teams Microsoft Teams does not provide an easy way to send messages to a personal channel. Therefore, DefectDojo can only send system scope notifications to Microsoft Teams.\nTo activate notifications to Microsoft Teams, you have to:\nConfigure an Incoming Webhook in a Teams channel and copy the URL of the webhook to the clipboard Activate Enable Microsoft Teams notifications in the System Settings Paste the URL of the Incoming Webhook into the field Msteams url Specific overrides System notification settings (scope: system) describe the sending of notifications to superadmins. User notification settings (scope: personal) describe sending notifications to the specific user.\nHowever, there is a specific use-case when the user decides to disable notifications (to decrease noise) but the system setting is used to override this behavior. These overrides apply only to user_mentioned and review_requested by default.\nThe scope of this setting is customizable (see environmental variable DD_NOTIFICATIONS_SYSTEM_LEVEL_TRUMP).\nFor more information about this behavior see the related pull request #9699\nWebhooks (experimental) DefectDojo also supports webhooks that follow the same events as other notifications (you can be notified in the same situations).

Your Connector will take note of this organizational structure and set up Records to help you translate those separate repositories into DefectDojos Product/Engagement/Test hierarchy.\nEach time your Connector runs a Discover operation, it will look for new Vendor-Equivalent-Products (VEPs). DefectDojo looks at the way the Vendor tool is set up and will create Records of VEPs based on how your tool is organized.\nRun Discover Manually Discover operations will automatically run on a regular basis, but they can also be run manually.

DefectDojo will create an Engagement nested under the Product specified in the Record Mapping. This Engagement will be called Global Connectors. The Global Connectors Engagement will track each separate Connection associated with the Product as a Test. On this sync, and each subsequent sync, the Test will store each vulnerability found by the tool as a Finding. How Sync handles new vulnerability data Whenever Sync runs, it will compare the latest scan data against the existing list of Findings for changes.\nIf there are new Findings detected, they will be added to the Test as new Findings.

Tiles are designed to provide relevant information and speed up navigation within DefectDojo.\nTiles can:\nAct as shortcuts for particular sets of Findings, Products, or other objects Visualize relevant metrics related to your Product Provide alerts on particular activity, track SLA Violations, failing imports or new Critical Findings Tile Components Each Tile contains four main components:\n1. A customizable icon. You can choose an icon and color for the Tile. If you wish, you can also have an icon’s color dynamically change from Green -\u0026gt; Yellow -\u0026gt; Red based on a value range. 2. A count of each object that meets the Tile’s filter conditions. For example, a Findings Tile will count the number of Findings filtered by the Tile. 3. A customizable Header which can be set to describe the function of the tile. 4. A customizable Footer which brings you to the related list of objects. For example, a Findings Tile’s footer will bring you to a list of Findings filtered by the Tile.\nTypes of Dashboard Tiles There are eight Tiles which you can choose from. These Tiles are explained in more detail below, along with examples of usage.\nProduct Tile Engagement Tile Test Tile Endpoint Tile SLA Violation Tile Scan Time Violation Tile Product Grade Tile Product, Engagement or Test Tile These Tiles allow you to quickly select a list of Products, Engagements or Tests based on the filter parameters you set. You can use this tile for ease in navigation.\nThe number on the tile represents the count of objects (Products, Engagement or Tests) contained within the tile’s filter parameters. Clicking the footer will take you to a filtered list of those objects.\nExample: Monitoring Engagements In Progress If you want to create a list of your In-Progress Engagements in DefectDojo, you can set up an Engagement tile which filters for that condition.\nCreate an Engagement tile, and from the Tile Filters set Engagement Status to In Progress. To make sure your Tile is accurately labeled, set the Header of your tile to ‘Engagements In Progress’. You could also create Engagement tiles for one or more other states, such as Blocked or Completed.\nFinding Tiles Finding tiles provide a count of Findings based on the filter parameters you set. As with other tiles, clicking the Footer will take you to a list of the Findings set by the tile.\nUsing filter parameters you can track Findings in a particular state or time period.\nExample: Monitoring Critical Findings If you wanted to be able to quickly access all of your Critical Findings in DefectDojo, you could do this by creating a tile.\nCreate a Finding tile, and from the Tile Filters set Severity to Critical. To make sure your Tile is accurately labeled, set the Header of the tile to ‘Critical Findings’. You can add additional filter parameters to make this tile more functional for your use-case. For example, if you wanted this tile to only track Open Findings (and ignore any Mitigated Findings) you could set the Active filter to Yes.\nEndpoint Tiles If you need to keep track of particular Endpoints, you can set up a Tile to quickly navigate to a filtered list. This tile can be set up to filter by Host, Product, Tags or other parameters that are relevant to the Endpoints you want to track.\nClicking the footer on this tile brings us to a filtered list of Endpoints which displays their status. DefectDojo will only create and track Endpoints with related vulnerabilities, so this will not include any Endpoints which have no vulnerabilities reported.\nExample: Monitor All Endpoints With Same Host If you wanted to use Endpoints to look at vulnerabilities on a certain part of your architecture, regardless of the associated Product, you could use an Endpoint Tile to filter for a particular URL. From there, you could see all Findings associated with that part of your network.\nCreate an Endpoint tile. For this example, we are setting the Host Contains field to ‘centralaction-items’, as that string is part of many Endpoint URLs in our infrastructure.​ Set your Header to a title which describes the intended function of your tile. In this example, we used ‘Host: centralaction-items’. SLA Violation Tile This Tile counts Findings which are at risk of violating SLA. It can be set to track all Products, or specific Products chosen from a list.\nExample: Findings Approaching SLA Violation If you want to create a filter for Findings which are within 7 days of SLA expiration, you can set up your filter parameters to track this. When setting the Filter parameters for the SLA Violation tile, set ‘Days Before Expiration’ to 7. Select either All Products, or a list of specific Products.\nSet the Header to describe the filter you’re applying, for example ‘SLA Violation - 3 Days Or Less’.\nClicking on the footer will bring you to a list of these Findings for you to address. This tile only tracks Active Findings, but will also track Findings with an expired SLA.\nScan Time Violation Tile This Tile is used to track specific Products to ensure that new scan data is being added on a regular basis.\nIf there are particular Products which you’re scanning on a regular interval, you can use this tile to ensure your tools and imports are running as expected.\nThis Tile will return a count and related list of Products which have not had new scan data added in the interval you’ve defined.\nExample: Automation Tracking If you have scanning tools set to run on a weekly basis, you can use this tile to make sure those automated processes are working correctly.\nFrom the Tile filters, select the target Products where the scan data will be imported via automation. Set the Days Since Last Scan field to ‘Past Week’. Set a descriptive name in the Header which communicates the interval you’re testing. If you have multiple scanning intervals that you want to monitor, you can set up multiple tiles to track each one.\nProduct Grade Title This Tile compares the Product Grade of all Products on your instance, so that you can track any Products which do not meet your grading standard.\nThis tile uses a comparison operator (\u0026lt;, =, \u0026lt;=, \u0026gt;=) to track Products which equal, exceed or fail to meet the Product Grade which you want to monitor.\nFor more information on how Product Grades are calculated, see our article on Product Health Grading.\nExample: Track Failing Products If you want to quickly access Products in your instance which do not meet your Grading standard, you can set up a Tile which handles that calculation. The Grading standard used in this example is ‘Less Than C’: we want our tile to flag any Products with a Grade of D or lower.\nCreate a Product Grade Tile. From the Filters list, set the Grade which you consider ‘failing’. In this case we’ll select C. In the Filters list, set a Comparison Operator to determine the logic used in counting your failing Products. In this case, we’ll select ‘Less Than’. As with other Product related Tiles, you can set the Tile to look at All Products in your instance, or only a specific list of Products.\nNext Steps: Learn how to Add, Edit or Delete your Dashboard Tiles.

When using DefectDojo, you’ll most likely be ingesting reports from the same tool on a regular basis, which means that duplicate Findings are highly likely.\nThis is where Deduplication comes in, a Smart feature which you can set up to automatically manage duplicate Findings.\nHow DefectDojo handles duplicates First, you import Test 1. Your report contains a vulnerability which is recorded as Finding A. Later, you import Test 2 which contains the same vulnerability. This will be recorded as Finding B, and Finding B will be marked as a duplicate of Finding A. Later still, you import Test 3 which also contains that vulnerability. This will be recorded as Finding C, which will be marked as a duplicate of Finding A. By creating and marking Duplicates in this way, DefectDojo ensures that all the work for the ‘original’ vulnerability is centralized on the original Finding page, without creating separate contexts, or giving your team the impression that there are multiple separate vulnerabilities which need to be addressed.\nBy default, these Tests would need to be nested under the same Product for Deduplication to be applied. If you wish, you can further limit the Deduplication scope to a single Engagement.\nDuplicate Findings are set as Inactive by default. This does not mean the Duplicate Finding itself is Inactive. Rather, this is so that your team only has a single active Finding to work on and remediate, with the implication being that once the original Finding is Mitigated, the Duplicates will also be Mitigated.\nDeduplication vs Reimport Deduplication and Reimport are similar processes but they have a key difference:\nWhen you Reimport to a Test, the Reimport process looks at incoming Findings, filters and discards any matches. Those matches will never be created as Findings or Finding Duplicates. Deduplication is applied \u0026lsquo;passively\u0026rsquo; on Findings that have already been created. It will identify duplicates in scope and label them, but it will not delete or discard the Finding unless \u0026lsquo;Delete Deduplicate Findings\u0026rsquo; is enabled. The \u0026lsquo;reimport\u0026rsquo; action of discarding a Finding always happens before deduplication; DefectDojo cannot deduplicate Findings that are never created as a result of Reimport\u0026rsquo;s filtering. When are duplicates appropriate? Duplicates are useful when you’re dealing with shared, but discrete Testing contexts. For example, if your Product is uploading Test results for two different repositories, which need to be compared, it’s useful to know which vulnerabilities are shared across those repositories.\nHowever, if DefectDojo is creating excess duplicates, this can also be a sign that you need to adjust your import processes.\nWhat do my duplicates indicate? The same vulnerability, but found in a different context: this is the appropriate way to use Duplicate Findings. If you have many components which are affected by the same vulnerability, you would likely want to know which components are affected to understand the scope of the problem.\n​ The same vulnerability, found in the same context: better options exist for this case. If the Duplicate Finding does not give you any new context on the vulnerability, or if you find yourself frequently ignoring or deleting your duplicate Findings, this is a sign that your process can be improved. For example, Reimport allows you to effectively manage incoming reports from a CI/CD pipeline. Rather than create a completely new Finding object for each duplicate, Reimport will make a note of the incoming duplicate without creating the Duplicate Finding at all. Next Steps: Enable and configure Deduplication from the System Settings page. Brush up on DefectDojo’s Product and Engagement data models to make sure that your environment is optimized for deduplication.

Personal Notifications are set by individual users, and will be received in addition to any System-Wide Notifications. In both cases, Role-Based Access Control rules apply, so users will not receive activity notifications for Products or Product Types (or their related objects) which they don’t have access to.\nNotification Delivery Methods There are four delivery methods for DefectDojo notifications:\nDefectDojo can share 🔔 Alerts, stored as a list in the DefectDojo interface DefectDojo can send notifications to an Email address DefectDojo can send notifications to Slack, in either a shared or individual channel DefectDojo can also send notifications to Microsoft Teams in a shared channel Notifications can be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.\nReceiving Slack and Teams notifications will require you to have a working integration.

Security data is highly sensitive, and DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s options for access control allow you to be specific about each team member’s access to information.\nTypes of Permissions DefectDojo manages four different kinds of permissions:\nUsers can be assigned as Members to Products or Product Types. A Product Membership comes with a Role which allows your users to view and interact with Data Types (Product Types, Products, Engagements, Tests and Findings) in DefectDojo. Users can have multiple Product or Product Type memberships, with different levels of access.\n​ Users can also have Configuration Permissions assigned, which allow them to access configuration pages in DefectDojo. Configuration Permissions are not related to Products or Product Types, and are not associated with Roles.\n​ Users can be assigned Global Roles, which give them a standardized level of access to all Products and Product Types.\n​ Users can be set up as Superusers: administrator level roles which give them control and access to all DefectDojo data and configuration. Each of these Permission types can also be assigned to User Group. If you have a large number of users in DefectDojo, such as a dedicated testing team for a particular Product, Groups allow you to set up and maintain permissions quickly.\nProduct/Product Type Membership \u0026amp; Roles When users are assigned as members to a Product or Product Type, they also receive a role which controls how they interact with the associated Finding data.\nRole Summaries Users can be assigned a role of Reader, Writer, Maintainer, Owner or API Importer, either globally or within a Product / Product Type.\n‘Underlying data’ refers to all Products, Engagements, Tests, Findings or Endpoints nested under a Product, or Product Type.\nReader Users can view underlying data on any Product or Product Type they are assigned to, and add comments. They cannot edit, add or otherwise modify any of the underlying data, but they can export Reports and add Notes to data.\n​ Writer Users have all Reader abilities, plus the ability to Add or Edit Engagements, Tests and Findings. They cannot add new Products, and they cannot Delete any underlying data.\n​ Maintainer Users have all Writer abilities, plus the ability to edit Product or Product Types. They can add new Members with Roles to the Product or Product Type, and they can also Delete Engagements, Tests, and Findings.\n​ Owner Users have the greatest amount of control over a Product or Product Type. They can designate other Owners, and can also Delete the Products or Product Types they’re assigned to.\n​ API Importer Users have limited abilities. This Role allows limited API access without exposing the majority of the API endpoints, so is useful for automation or users who are meant to be ‘external’ to DefectDojo. They can view underlying data, Add / Edit Engagements, and Import Scan Data. For detailed information on Roles, please see our Role Permission Chart.\nGlobal Roles Users with Global Roles can view and interact with any Data Type (Product Types, Products, Engagements, Tests and Findings) in DefectDojo depending on their assigned Role.\nGroup Memberships User Groups can be added as Members of a Product or Product Type. Users who are part of the Group will inherit access to all associated Products or Product Types, and will inherit the Role assigned to the Group.\nUsers with multiple roles If a User is assigned as a member of a Product, they are not granted any associated Product Type permissions by default.\nA User\u0026rsquo;s Product Role always supersedes their \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; Product Type Role.\n​\nA User\u0026rsquo;s Product / Product Type Role always supersedes their Global Role within the underlying Product or Product Type. For example, if a User has a Product Type Role of Reader, but is also assigned as an Owner on a Product nested under that Product Type, they will have additional Owner permissions added for that Product only.\n​\nRoles cannot take away permissions, they can only add additional ones. For example, If a User has a Product Type Role or Global Role of Owner, assigning them a Reader role on a particular Product will not take away their Owner permissions on that Product.\n​\nSuperuser status always supersedes any Roles assigned.\nSuperusers Superusers (Admins) have no limitations in the system. They can change all settings, manage users and have read / write access to all data. They can also change access rules for all users in DefectDojo. Superusers will also receive notifications for all system issues and alerts.\nBy default, the first account created on a new DefectDojo instance will have Superuser permissions. That user will be able to edit permissions for all subsequent DefectDojo users. Only an existing Superuser can add another superuser, or add a Global Role to a user.\nConfiguration Permissions Configuration Permissions, although similar, are not related to Products or Roles. They must be assigned separately from Roles. Regular users do not have any Configuration Permissions by default, and assigning these configuration permissions should be done carefully.\nUsers can have Configuration Permissions assigned in different ways:\nUsers can be assigned Configuration Permissions directly. Specific permissions can be configured directly on a User page.\n​ User Groups can be assigned Configuration Permissions. As with Roles, specific Configuration Permissions can be added to Groups, which will give all Group members these permissions. Superusers have all Configuration Permissions, so they do not have a Configuration Permission section on their User page.\nGroup Configuration Permissions If users are part of a Group, they also have Group Configuration Permissions which control their level of access to a Group’s configuration. Group Permissions do not correspond to the Group’s Product or Product Type membership.\nIf users create a new Group, they will be given the Owner role of the new Group by default.\nFor more information on Configuration Permissions, see our Configuration Permissions Chart.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":125,"permalink":"/en/user_management/about-permissions--roles/","summary":"If you have a team of users working in DefectDojo, it\u0026rsquo;s important to set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) appropriately so that users can only access specific data.","tags":[],"title":"About Permissions \u0026 Roles"},{"content":"This parser imports the Acunetix Scanner with xml output or Acunetix 360 Scanner with JSON output.\nSample Scan Data Sample Acunetix Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":126,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/acunetix/","summary":"This parser imports the Acunetix Scanner with xml output or Acunetix 360 Scanner with JSON output.\nSample Scan Data Sample Acunetix Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"Acunetix Scanner"},{"content":"If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already set up DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Jira Configuration, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to start by linking one or more Jira instances to DefectDojo.\n​\nSee this guide for more information: https://support.defectdojo.com/en/articles/8766815-connect-defectdojo-to-jira\nOnce a Jira configuration is connected to a Product, Jira and the Product will communicate to do the following:\nUse DefectDojo Findings to create Jira Issues, which automatically contain all relevant Finding information and links Bidirectional Sync, allowing for status updates and comments to be created on both the Jira and DefectDojo side.

Useful if you don\u0026rsquo;t require full Finding context in Jira (for example, if someone is working on this Issue who mainly works in DefectDojo, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need the full picture in JIRA as well.)\n​\n​**Here is an example of a jira_limited Issue:**​ Component If you manage your Jira project using Components, you can assign the appropriate Component for DefectDojo here.\nCustom fields\nIf you don’t need to use Custom Fields with DefectDojo issues, you can leave this field as ‘null’.\nHowever, if your Jira Project Settings require you to use Custom Fields on new Issues, you will need to hard-code these mappings.\nJira Cloud now allows you to create a default Custom Field value directly in-app. See Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s documentation on Custom Fields for more information on how to configure this.\nNote that DefectDojo cannot send any Issue-specific metadata as Custom Fields, only a default value. This section should only be set up if your JIRA Project requires that these Custom Fields exist in every Issue in your project.\nFollow this guide to get started working with Custom Fields.\nJira labels\nSelect the relevant labels that you want the Issue to be created with in Jira, e.g. DefectDojo, YourProductName..\nDefault assignee The name of the default assignee in Jira. If left blank, DefectDojo will follow the default behaviour in your Jira Project when creating Issues.\nCheckbox options Add vulnerability Id as a Jira label This allows you to add the Vulnerability ID data as a Jira Label automatically. Vulnerability IDs are added to Findings from individual security tools - these may be Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs or a different format, specific to the tool reporting the Finding.\nEnable engagement epic mapping In DefectDojo, Engagements represent a collection of work. Each Engagement contains one or more tests, which contain one or more Findings which need to be mitigated. Epics in Jira work in a similar way, and this checkbox allows you to push Engagements to Jira as Epics.\nAn Engagement in DefectDojo - note the three findings listed at the bottom.\n​ How the same Engagement becomes an Epic when pushed to JIRA - the Engagement\u0026rsquo;s Findings are also pushed, and live inside the Engagement as Child Issues. Push All Issues If checked, DefectDojo will automatically push any Active and Verified Findings to Jira as Issues. If left unchecked, all Findings will need to be pushed to Jira manually.\nPush notes If enabled, Jira comments will populate on the associated Finding in DefectDojo, under Notes on the issue(screenshot), and vice versa; Notes on Findings will be added to the associated Jira Issue as Comments.\nSend SLA notifications as comment? If enabled, any Issue which breaches DefectDojo’s Service Level Agreement rules will have comments added to the Jira issue indicating this. These comments will be posted daily until the Issue is resolved.\nService Level Agreements can be configured under Configuration \u0026gt; SLA Configuration in DefectDojo and assigned to each Product.\nSend Risk Acceptance expiration notifications as comment? If enabled, any Issue where the associated DefectDojo Risk Acceptance expires will have a comment added to the Jira issue indicating this. These comments will be posted daily until the Issue is resolved.\nTesting \u0026amp; Troubleshooting the Jira integration Test 1: Do Findings successfully push to Jira? In order to test that the Jira integration is working properly, you can add a new blank Finding to the Product associated with Jira in DefectDojo. Product \u0026gt; Findings \u0026gt; Add New Finding.\nAdd whatever title severity and description you wish, and then click “Finished”. The Finding should appear as an Issue in Jira with all of the relevant metadata.\nIf Jira Issues are not being created correctly, check your Notifications for error codes.\nConfirm that the Jira User associated with DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Jira Configuration has permission to create and update issues on that particular Jira Project. Test 2: Jira Webhooks send and receive updates from DefectDojo In order to test the Jira webhooks, add a Note to a Finding which also exists in JIRA as an Issue (for example, the test issue in the section above).\nIf the webhooks are configured correctly, you should see the Note in Jira as a Comment on the issue.\nIf this doesn’t work correctly, it could be due to a Firewall issue on your Jira instance blocking the Webhook.\nDefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Firewall Rules include a checkbox for Jira Cloud, which needs to be enabled before DefectDojo can receive Webhook messages from Jira.

Rather than create a new Test or Engagement for each ‘run’ of the pipeline, you could have each report flow into the same Test using Reimport.\nReimport: Process Summary Reimporting data does not replace any old data in the Test, instead, it compares the incoming scan file with the existing scan data in a test to make informed decisions:\nBased on the latest file, which vulnerabilities are still present? Which vulnerabilities are no longer present? Which vulnerabilities have been previously solved, but have since been reintroduced? The Test will track and separate each scan version via Import History, so that you can check the Finding changes in your Test over time.\nReimport Logic: Create, Ignore, Close or Reopen When using Reimport, DefectDojo will compare the incoming scan data with the existing scan data, and then apply changes to the Findings contained within your Test as follows:\nCreate Findings Any vulnerabilities which were not contained in the previous import will be added to the Test automatically as new Findings.\nIgnore existing Findings If any incoming Findings match Findings that already exist, the incoming Findings will be discarded rather than recorded as Duplicates. These Findings have been recorded already - no need to add a new Finding object. The Test page will show these Findings as Left Untouched.\nClose Findings If there are any Findings that already exist in the Test but which are not present in the incoming report, you can choose to automatically set those Findings to Inactive and Mitigated (on the assumption that those vulnerabilities have been resolved since the previous import). The Test page will show these Findings as Closed.\nIf you don’t want any Findings to be closed, you can disable this behavior on Reimport:\nUncheck the Close Old Findings checkbox if using the UI Set close_old_findings to False if using the API Reopen Findings If there are any Closed Findings which appear again in a Reimport, they will automatically be Reopened. The assumption is that these vulnerabilities have occurred again, despite previous mitigation. The Test page will track these Findings as Reactivated. If you’re using a triage-less scanner, or you don’t otherwise want Closed Findings to reactivate, you can disable this behavior on Reimport:\nSet do_not_reactivate to True if using the API Check the Do Not Reactivate checkbox if using the UI Opening the Reimport form The Re-Import Findings form can be accessed on any Test page, under the ⚙️Gear drop-down menu.\n##\nThe Re-import Findings Form will not allow you to import a different scan type, or change the destination of the Findings you’re trying to upload. If you’re trying to do one of those things, you’ll need to use the Import Scan Form.\nWorking with Import History Import History for a given test is listed under the Test Overview header on the Test page.\nThis table shows each Import or Reimport as a single line with a Timestamp, along with Branch Tag, Build ID, Commit Hash and Version columns if those were specified.\nActions This header indicates the actions taken by an Import/Reimport.\n# created indicates the number of new Findings created at the time of Import/Reimport # closed shows the number of Findings that were closed by a Reimport (due to not existing in the incoming report). # left untouched shows the count of Open Findings which were unchanged by a Reimport (because they also existed in the incoming report). # reactivated shows any Closed Findings which were reopened by an incoming Reimport.

Reimport collapses the context and Findings associated with a recurring test into a single Test page, where you can review import history and track vulnerability changes across scans.\nCreate an Engagement to store the CI/CD results for the object you’re running CI/CD on. This could be a code repository where you have CI/CD actions set up to run. Generally, you want a separate Engagement set up for each pipeline so that you can quickly understand where the Finding results are coming from.\n​ Each CI/CD action will import data to DefectDojo in a separate step, so each of those should be mapped to a separate Test. For example, if each pipeline execution runs an NPM-audit as well as a dependency scan, each scan result will need to flow into a Test (nested under the Engagement).\n​ You do not need to create a new Test each time the CI/CD action runs. Instead, you can Reimport data to the same test location. ​\nReimport in action DefectDojo will compare the incoming scan data with the existing scan data, and then apply changes to the Findings contained within your Test as follows:\n​\nCreate Findings Any vulnerabilities which were not contained in the previous import will be added to the Test automatically as new Findings.\n​\nIgnore existing Findings If any incoming Findings match Findings that already exist, the incoming Findings will be discarded rather than recorded as Duplicates. These Findings have been recorded already - no need to add a new Finding object. The Test page will show these Findings as Left Untouched.\n​\nClose Findings If there are any Findings that already exist in the Test but which are not present in the incoming report, you can choose to automatically set those Findings to Inactive and Mitigated (on the assumption that those vulnerabilities have been resolved since the previous import). The Test page will show these Findings as Closed.\nIf you don’t want any Findings to be closed, you can disable this behavior on Reimport:\nUncheck the Close Old Findings checkbox if using the UI Set close_old_findings to False if using the API\n​ Reopen Findings If there are any Closed Findings which appear again in a Reimport, they will automatically be Reopened. The assumption is that these vulnerabilities have occurred again, despite previous mitigation. The Test page will track these Findings as Reactivated. If you’re using a triage-less scanner, or you don’t otherwise want Closed Findings to reactivate, you can disable this behavior on Reimport:\nSet do_not_reactivate to True if using the API Check the Do Not Reactivate checkbox if using the UI Working with Import History Import History for a given test is listed under the Test Overview header on the Test page.\nThis table shows each Import or Reimport as a single line with a Timestamp, along with Branch Tag, Build ID, Commit Hash and Version columns if those were specified.\nActions This header indicates the actions taken by an Import/Reimport.\n# created indicates the number of new Findings created at the time of Import/Reimport # closed shows the number of Findings that were closed by a Reimport (due to not existing in the incoming report). # left untouched shows the count of Open Findings which were unchanged by a Reimport (because they also existed in the incoming report). # reactivated shows any Closed Findings which were reopened by an incoming Reimport. Why not simply use Import? Although both methods are possible, Import should be reserved for new occurrences of Findings and Data, while Reimport should be applied for further iterations of the same data.\nIf your CI/CD pipeline runs an Import and creates a new Test object each time, each Import will give you a collection of discrete Findings which you will then need to manage as separate objects. Using Reimport alleviates this problem and eliminates the amount of ‘cleanup’ you’ll need to do when a vulnerability is resolved.\nUsing Reimport allows you to store each recurring report on the same page, and maintains a continuity of each time new data was added to the Test.\nHowever, if you’re using the same scanning tool in multiple locations or contexts, it may be more appropriate to create a separate Test for each location or context.

For Open Source release notes, please see the Releases page on GitHub.\nNov 17, 2024 Version 2.40.2\n(API) Added an API endpoint to get the DefectDojo version number: /api/v2/version (Pro) (API) Multiple Metadata objects can now be added to a single Endpoint, Finding or Product via POST or PATCH to /api/v2/metadata/ . Previously, only one Metadata key/value pair could be updated per call. (Beta UI) You can now Clear Alerts in the Beta UI. (Beta UI) Corrected an issue with Beta UI’s form validation when trying to connect a Jira Project with an Engagement. (Beta UI) Fixed an issue in the Beta UI where new Product Tiles could not be created. (Reports) Changes have been made to the Report Generator\u0026rsquo;s description text to clarify how new reports are created from existing reports. (Findings) “Verified” is now an optional status for many Finding workflows. This can be changed from the System Settings page in the Legacy UI (not yet implemented in Beta UI). (Tools) Update to AWS Prowler parser - can now handle the ‘event_time’ parameter Nov 14, 2024 Version 2.40.1\n(API) Added a method to validate for file extensions, when \u0026lsquo;artifact\u0026rsquo; files are added to a test (images, for example) (Cloud Portal) Fixed an issue where QR codes were not being generated correctly for MFA setup. (Pro) (Dashboards) Insights dashboards can now filter by Product Tag (Pro) (Notifications) Added a new notification template for ‘Engagement Closed’ - Email, Alerts, Teams, Slack (Tools) Fixed an issue with the Burp Entreprise HTML parser not correctly handling certain reports (Tags) Tags are now forced to lowercase when created Nov 4, 2024 Version 2.40.0\n(API) Engagement_End_Date is now honored when submitted via /import /reimport endpoint. (API) Corrected an issue with the /import endpoint where old Findings were not being mitigated correctly. (Beta UI) Certain Error 400 notifications will now be displayed as ‘toasts’ in the beta UI with a better error description, rather than redirecting to a generic 400 page. (Beta UI) Dojo-CLI and Universal Importer are now available for download in-app. See External Tools menu in the top-right hand menu of the Beta UI. (Connectors) Multiple connectors of the same type can now be added. Each Connector will create a unique Engagement which will be populated with Findings. (Pro) (Connectors) AWS Security Hub connector can now find any AWS delegated accounts associated with a centralized account. All Security Hub Findings from a connector will be tagged with the appropriate AwsAccountId field, and additional Products can be added for each. (Pro) (CLI Tools) Dojo-CLI tool now available: a command-line tool which you can use to manage imports and exports to your Cloud instance. To get started, download the app from the External Tools menu. (Deduplication) There’s no longer a brief service interruption when changes are applied to Deduplication Settings. Those changes can be applied without restarting the service. (Tools) Added a new parser for AWS Inspector2 Findings. Setting up multiple AWS Hub accounts with a Connector If you manage Security Hub findings for multiple accounts from a centralized administrator account, you will need to create the IAM user under that account and configure the Connector with it in order to retrieve findings from those sub-accounts with a single connector configuration.\n\u0026ldquo;Member\u0026rdquo; accounts (either invited manually or automatically associated when using AWS Organizations) will be detected by the Discover operation, and Products will be created for each of your account + region pairs based on the administrator account\u0026rsquo;s cross-region aggregation settings.\nSee this section of the AWS Docs about cross-region aggregation with multiple accounts for more information.\nOnce you have created your IAM user and assigned it the necessary permissions using an appropriate policy/role, you will need to generate an access key and provide the \u0026ldquo;Access Key\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Secret Key\u0026rdquo; components in the relevant connector configuration fields. The \u0026ldquo;Location\u0026rdquo; field should be populated with the appropriate API endpoint for your region. For example, to retrieve results from the us-east-1 region, you would supply https://securityhub.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. Note that we rely on Security Hub\u0026rsquo;s cross-region aggregation to pull findings from more than one region. If cross-region aggregation is enabled, you should supply the API endpoint for your \u0026ldquo;Aggregation Region\u0026rdquo;. Additional linked regions will have ProductRecords created for them in DefectDojo based on your AWS account IDs and the region names. October 29, 2024 Version 2.39.4 / 2.39.3\n(API) Corrected \u0026lsquo;multiple positional arguments\u0026rsquo; issue with /import endpoint (Metrics) Dashboards can now handle multiple Products or Product Types simultaneously: this includes the Executive, Program, Remediation and Tool insights dashboards. (Pro) (Tools) OSV, Tenable parsers have been made more robust October 21, 2024 Version 2.39.1\n(Beta UI) Parent Object links have been added to the Metadata table to help contextualize the page you\u0026rsquo;re on (Beta UI) Improved \u0026ldquo;Toggle Columns\u0026rdquo; menu on tables (Beta UI) Added additional helptext for Simple Risk Acceptance, SLA Enforcement (Beta UI) Improved Test View with better Import History and Active Finding Severity Breakdown elements (Import) Development Environments which do not already exist can now be created via \u0026lsquo;auto create context\u0026rsquo; (Metrics) All Metrics dashboards can now be exported as a PDF (Remediation Insights, Program Insights, Tool Insights) (Pro) October 7, 2024 Version 2.39.0\n(Beta UI) Dropdown menus for Import Scan / Reimport Scan no longer block the active element of a form. (Beta UI) Finding counts by Severity now disregard Out Of Scope / False Positive Findings. (Dashboard) Tile filters with a Boolean filter of False are now saving correctly. E.G. If you tried to create a Tile with a filter condition of “Has Jira = No” previously this would not be applied correctly. (Jira) Added help text for \u0026lsquo;Push All Issues\u0026rsquo;. (Tools) AWS Security Hub EPSS score now parses correctly. September 30, 2024 Version 2.38.4\n(API) Object History can now be accessed via the API. (API Docs) Generating the response schema for certain API endpoints no longer breaks the Swagger interface. (Metrics) Added Executive Insights dashboard, Select a Product or Product type, and you can view an executive summary of that Product/Product Type’s security posture with relevant stats. (Pro) (Passwords) Password creation for new users can now be made optional upon request. This feature is toggled via the back-end. September 23, 2024 Version 2.38.3\n(API) /global_role endpoint now supports prefetching. (API) It is now possible to prefetch a Finding with attached files via API. (Login) A new \u0026ldquo;Forgot Username\u0026rdquo; link has been added to the login form. The link will navigate to a page which requests the user\u0026rsquo;s email address. The username will be sent to that address if it exists. Risk Acceptances Notes are now added to Findings when they are removed from Risk Acceptances. (Risk Acceptance) Risk Acceptance overhaul. Feature has been extended with new functions. See Risk Acceptance documentation for more details. Tools Qualys HackerGuardian parser added. Tools Semgrep Parser updated with new severity mappings. HackerOne parser updated and now supports bug bounty reports. Tools fixed an issue where certain tools would not process asyncronously: Whitehat_Sentinel, SSLyze, SSLscan, Qualys_Webapp, Mend, Intsights, H1, and Blackduck. September 16, 2024 Version 2.38.2\n(Beta UI) Jira integration in Beta UI now has parity with Legacy UI. Ability to Push To Jira has been added, and the Jira ticket view has been added to Findings, Engagements, and all other related objects in DefectDojo. (Finding SLAs) Added “Mitigated Within SLA” Finding filter, so that users can now count how many Findings were mitigated on time, and how many were not. Previously, we were only able to filter Findings that were currently violating SLA or not, rather than ones that had historically violated SLA or not. (Metrics) “Mitigated Within SLA” simple metric added to Remediation Insights page. (Reports) Custom Content text box no longer renders as HTML. (Tools) Wiz Parser now supports SCA format. (Tools) Fortify now supports a wider range of .fpr files. (Tools) Changed name of Netsparker Scan to Invicti Scan following their acquisition. Integrations that use the ‘Netsparker’ terminology will still work as expected, but now ‘Invicti’ appears in our tools list. (Universal Importer) Tag Inheritance has been added to Universal Importer. Tags can now be added to Findings from that tool. (Pro) September 9, 2024 Version 2.39.1\n(Beta UI) Clearing a date filter and re-applying it no longer throws a 400 error. (Dashboard) Dashboard Tag Filters now work correctly in both legacy and beta UIs. (MFA) When an admin enforced Global MFA on a DefectDojo instance, there was a loop state that could occur with new users attempting to set up their accounts. This issue has been corrected, and new users can set a password before enabling MFA. (Permissions) When a user had permission to edit a Product, but not a Product Type, there was a bug where they were unable to submit an ‘Edit Product’ form (due to interaction with the Product Type). This has been corrected. (Reimport) Reimport now correctly records additional vulnerability IDs beyond 1. In the past, Findings that had more than one Vulnerability ID (a CVE, for example) would have those additional Vulnerability IDs discarded on reimport, so users were potentially losing those additional Vulnerability IDs. (Tools) Threat Composer parser added (Tools) Legitify parser added (Tools) EPSS score / percentile will now be imported from Aquasec files Sepember 3, 2024 Version 2.38.0\n(API) Better naming conventions on Mitigated and Discovered date filters: these are now labeled Mitigated/Discovered On, Mitigated/Discovered Before, Mitigated/Discovered After. (Beta UI) Pre-filtered Finding Routes added to Sidebar: you can now quickly filter for Active Findings, Mitigated Findings, All Risk Acceptances, All Finding Groups. (Beta UI) Beta UI Findings datatable can now apply every filter that the legacy UI could: filter Findings by (Last Reviewed, Mitigated Date, Endpoint Host, Reviewers… etc). (Beta UI) Beta UI OAuth settings leading to a 404 loop - bug fixed and menu now works as expected. (Beta UI) Vulnerable Hosts page no longer returns 404. (Beta UI) Sorting the Findings data table by Reporter now functions correctly. (Connectors) Dependency-Track Connector now available. (Pro) (Deduplication Tuner) Deduplication Tuner now available in beta UI under Enterprise Settings \u0026gt; Deduplication Tuner. (Filters) Filtering Findings by Date now applies the filter as expected. (Filters) Sorting by Severity now orders by lowest-highest severity instead of alphabetically (Reimport) Reimporting Findings that have been Risk-Accepted no longer changes their status to ‘Mitigated’. (Risk Acceptance) Updating the Simple Risk Acceptance or the Full Risk Acceptance flag on a Product now updates the Product as expected. August 28, 2024 Version 2.37.3\n(API) New Endpoint: /finding_groups allows you to GET, add Findings to, delete, or otherwise interact with Finding Groups. (Pro) (Beta UI) Relative date ranges for Findings have been added to Finding Filters (last 30 days, last 90 days, etc) (Beta UI) Bulk Edit / Risk Acceptance / Finding Group actions are now available in beta UI. (Beta UI) Finding Groups are now available in the beta UI. Selecting multiple Findings allows you to create a Finding Group, provided those Findings are in the same Test. (Beta UI) Enhanced Endpoint View now available in beta UI. (Beta UI) Jira Instances can now be added and edited via beta UI. (Connectors) SonarQube / SonarCloud Connector added. (Pro) (Questionnaires) Anonymous Questionnaires can now be added to an Engagement after they are completed. This solves an issue where users wanted to have their team complete questionnaires related to a Product without giving the user access to the complete Product on DefectDojo.

Required Attributes are the attributes that DefectDojo requires from the SAML response.\n​ 8. Attribute Mapping contains a formula for how you want these attributes to be matched to a user. For example, if your SAML response returns an email, you can associate it with a DefectDojo user with the formula email=email.\n​\nThe left side of the ‘=’ sign represents the attribute you want to map from the SAML response. The right side is a user’s field in DefectDojo, which you want this attribute to map to.\n​\nThis is a required field for this form.\n​ 9. Remote SAML Metadata is the URL where your SAML Identity Provider is located.\n​ 10. If you would prefer to upload your own SAML Metadata, you can upload an XML file to Local SAML Metadata. You will need at least one metadata source before you can successfully use SAML.\n​ 11. Finally, check the Enable SAML checkbox at the bottom of this form to confirm that you want to use SAML to log in. Once this is enabled, you will see the Login With SAML button on the DefectDojo Login Page.\nAdditional SAML Options: Create Unknown User allows you to decide whether or not to automatically create a new user in DefectDojo if they aren’t found in the SAML response.\nAllow Unknown Attributes allows you to authorize users who have attributes which are not found in the Attribute Mapping field.\nSign Assertions/Responses will require any incoming SAML responses to be signed.\nSign Logout Requests forces DefectDojo to sign any logout requests.\nForce Authentication determines whether you want to force your users to authenticate using your Identity Provider each time, regardless of existing sessions.\nEnable SAML Debugging will log more detailed SAML output for debugging purposes.\nSet up OAuth Login (Google, Gitlab, Auth0…) Start by navigating to the Plugin Manager \u0026gt; Enterprise Settings page in DefectDojo.\n​ 2.

In Jira, this is the string associated with an Issue (e.g. the word ‘EXAMPLE’ in an issue called EXAMPLE-123). If you don’t know your issue key, create a new Issue in the Jira Project. In the screenshot below, we can see that the issue key on our Jira Project is DEF.\n​ ​ 11. Click Submit. DefectDojo will automatically look for appropriate mappings in Jira and add them to the configuration. You are now ready to link this configuration to one or more Products in DefectDojo.\nAdd Jira Configuration (Standard) The Standard Jira Configuration adds a few additional steps to allow for more precise control over Jira mappings and interactions. This can be changed after a Jira configuration has been added, even if it was created using the Express method.\n​\nAdditional Configuration Options Epic Name ID: If you have multiple Epic types in Jira, you can specify the one you want to use by finding its ID in the Jira Field Spec.\n​\nTo obtain the \u0026lsquo;Epic name id\u0026rsquo; visit https://\u0026lt;YOUR JIRA URL\u0026gt;/rest/api/2/field and search for Epic Name. Copy the number out of cf[number] and paste it here.\n​\n​ Reopen Transition ID: If you want a specific Jira Transition to Reopen an issue, you can specify the Transition ID here. If using the Express Jira Configuration, DefectDojo will automatically find an appropriate Transition and create the mapping.\n​\nVisit https://\u0026lt;YOUR JIRA URL\u0026gt;/rest/api/latest/issue/\u0026lt;ANY VALID ISSUE KEY\u0026gt;/transitions? expand-transitions.fields to find the ID for your Jira instance. Paste it in the Reopen Transition ID field.\n​\n​ Close Transition ID: If you want a specific Jira Transition to Close an issue, you can specify the Transition ID here. If using the Express Jira Configuration, DefectDojo will automatically find an appropriate Transition and create the mapping.\n​\nVisit https://\u0026lt;YOUR JIRA URL\u0026gt;/rest/api/latest/issue/\u0026lt;ANY VALID ISSUE KEY\u0026gt;/transitions? expand-transitions.fields to find the ID for your Jira instance. Paste it in the Close Transition ID field.\n​\n​ Mapping Severity Fields: Each Jira Issue has an associated Priority, which DefectDojo will automatically assign based on the Severity of a Finding. Enter the names of each Priority which you want to map to, for Info, Low, Medium, High and Critical Severities.\n​\n​ Finding Text - if you want to add additional standardized text to each Issue created, you can enter that text here. This is not text that maps to any field in Jira, but additional text that is added to the Issue Description. \u0026ldquo;Created by DefectDojo\u0026rdquo; for example. Comments (in Jira) and Notes (in DefectDojo) can be kept in sync.

Automation like this can take a few different forms:\nA daily import which scans your environment on a daily basis, and then imports the results of the scan to DefectDojo (similar to our Connectors feature) A CI/CD pipeline which scans new code as it is deployed, and imports the results to DefectDojo as a triggered action These pipelines can be created by directly calling our API /reimport endpoint with an attached scan file in a way that closely resembles our Import Scan Form.\nUniversal Importer - out of the box CI/CD tool DefectDojo maintains a Universal Importer which can be set up with existing CI/CD pipelines, triggered via GitHub actions, or run in any other automated context. The Universal Importer runs in a separate container, and will call your DefectDojo instance’s API in the appropriate way.\nThe Universal Importer is a useful way to leverage the API without needing to create and maintain the necessary API calls in your own pipeline. This is generally a faster solution than writing your own code.\nIf you have an active DefectDojo subscription and want to request a copy of the Universal Importer, please contact us at support at defectdojo dot com\ralong with the operating system you want to use to run the tool.\nWorking with DefectDojo’s API DefectDojo’s API is documented in-app using the OpenAPI framework. You can access this documentation from the User Menu in the top right-hand corner, under ‘API v2 OpenAPI3’.\n- The documentation can be used to test API calls with various parameters, and does so using your own user’s API Token.\nIf you need to access an API token for a script or another integration, you can find that information under the API v2 Token option from the same menu.\nGeneral API Considerations Although our OpenAPI documentation is detailed regarding the parameters that can be used with each endpoint, it assumes that the reader has a solid understanding of DefectDojo’s key concepts. (Product Hierarchy, Findings, Deduplication, etc). Users who want a working import integration but are less familiar with DefectDojo as a whole should consider our Universal Importer. DefectDojo’s API can sometimes create unintended data objects, particularly if ‘Auto-Create Context’ is used on the /import or /reimport endpoint. Fortunately, it is very difficult to accidentally delete data using the API. Most objects can only be removed using a dedicated DELETE call to the relevant endpoint. Specific notes on /import and /reimport endpoints The /reimport endpoint can be used for both an initial Import, or a “Reimport” which extends a Test with additional Findings. You do not need to first create a Test with /import before you can use the /reimport endpoint. As long as ‘Auto Create Context’ is enabled, the /reimport endpoint can create a new Test, Engagement, Product or Product Type. In almost all cases, you can use the /reimport endpoint exclusively when adding data via API.\nHowever, the /import endpoint can instead be used for a pipeline where you always want to store each scan result in a discrete Test object, rather than using /reimport to handle the diff within a single Test object. Either option is acceptable, and the endpoint you choose depends on your reporting structure, or whether you need to inspect an isolated run of a Pipeline.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":189,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/import_scan_files/api_pipeline_modelling/","summary":"DefectDojo’s API allows for robust pipeline solutions, which automatically ingest new scans to your instance.

This can be managed in two different ways:\nFindings can be created as Issues manually, per-Finding. Findings can be pushed automatically if the \u0026lsquo;Push All Issues\u0026rsquo; setting is enabled on a Product. (This applies only to Findings that are Active and Verified). Additionally, you have the option to push Finding Groups to Jira instead of individual Findings. This will create a single Issue which contains many related DefectDojo Findings.\nPushing a Finding to Jira Manually From a Finding page in DefectDojo, navigate to the JIRA heading. If the Finding does not already exist in JIRA as an Issue, the JIRA header will have a value of \u0026lsquo;None\u0026rsquo;.\n​ Clicking on the arrow next to the None value will create a new Jira issue. The State the issue is created in will depend on your team\u0026rsquo;s workflow and Jira configuration with DefectDojo. If the Finding does not appear, refresh the page.\n​\n​ ​ 3. Once the Issue is created, DefectDojo will create a link to the issue made up of the Jira key and the Issue ID. This link will also have a red trash can next to it, to allow you to delete the Issue from Jira.\n​\n4. Clicking the Arrow again will push all changes made to an issue to Jira, and update the Jira Issue accordingly. If \u0026lsquo;Push All Issues\u0026rsquo; setting is enabled on the Finding\u0026rsquo;s associated Product, this process will happen automatically.\nHow Jira Issues and Findings interact Jira issues will impact their associated Finding in certain ways.\nJira Comments If a comment is added to a Jira Issue, the same comment will be added to the Finding, under the Notes section. Likewise, if a Note is added to a Finding, the Note will be added to the Jira issue as a comment. Jira Status Changes The Jira Configuration on DefectDojo has entries for two Jira Transitions which will trigger a status change on a Finding.\nWhen the \u0026lsquo;Close\u0026rsquo; Transition is performed on Jira, the associated Finding will also Close, and become marked as Inactive and Mitigated on DefectDojo. DefectDojo will record this change on the Finding page under the Mitigated By heading.\n​ When the \u0026lsquo;Reopen\u0026rsquo; Transition is performed on the Jira Issue, the associated Finding will be set as Active on DefectDojo, and will lose its Mitigated status. Push Finding Groups as Jira Issues If you have Finding Groups enabled, you can push a Group of Findings to Jira as a single Issue rather than separate Issues for each Finding.\nThe Jira Issue associated with a Finding Group cannot be interacted with or deleted by DefectDojo, however. It must be deleted directly from the Jira instance.\nAutomatically Create and Push Finding Groups With Auto-Push To Jira Enabled, and a Group By option selected on import:\nAs long as the Finding Groups are being created successfully, the Finding Group is what will automatically push to Jira as an Issue, not the individual Findings.\nChange Jira settings for a specific Engagement Different Engagements within a Product can have different underlying Jira settings as a result.

From there, you can select Edit Record, or Delete Record.\nEdit a Record Clicking Edit Record will open a window which allows you to change the destination product in DefectDojo. You can either select an existing Product from the drop-down menu, or you can type in the name of a new Product you wish to create.\nChange the Mapping of a Record The scan data associated with a Record can be directed to flow into a different Product by changing the mapping.\nSelect, or type in the name of a new Product from the drop-down menu to the right.\nEdit the State of a Record The State of a Record can be changed from this menu as well. Records can be switched from Good to Ignored (or vice versa) by choosing an option from the State dropdown list.\nIgnoring a Record If you wish to ‘switch off’ one of the records or disregard the data it’s sending to DefectDojo, you can choose to ‘Ignore’ the record. An ‘Ignored’ record will move to the Unmapped Records list and will not push any new data to DefectDojo.\nYou can Ignore a Mapped Record (which will remove the mapping), or a New Record (from the unmapped Records list).\nRestoring an Ignored Record If you would like to remove the Ignored status from a record, you can change it back to New with the same State dropdown menu.\nIf Auto-Map Records is enabled, the Record will return to its original mapping once the Discover operation runs again.\n​ If Auto-Map Records is not enabled, DefectDojo will not automatically restore a previous mapping, so you’ll need to set up the mapping for this Record again. Delete a Record You can also Delete Records, which will remove them from the Unmapped or Mapped Records table.\nKeep in mind that the Discover function will always import all records from a tool - meaning that even if a Record is deleted from DefectDojo, it will become re-discovered later (and will return to the list of Records to be mapped again).\nIf you plan on removing the underlying Vendor-Equivalent Product from your scan tool, then Deleting the Record is a good option. Otherwise, the next Discover operation will see that the associated data is missing, and this Record will change state to \u0026lsquo;Missing\u0026rsquo;.\n​ However, if the underlying Vendor-Equivalent Product still exists, it will be Discovered again on a future Discover operation. To prevent this behaviour, you can instead Ignore the Record. Does this affect any imported data? No. All Findings, Tests and Engagements created by a sync record will remain in DefectDojo even after a Record is deleted. Deleting a record or a configuration will only remove the data-flow process, and won’t delete any vulnerability data from DefectDojo or your tool.\nNext Steps If your Records have been mapped, learn how to import data via Sync operations.

Note that this may affect Deduplication, as Deduplication generally uses the titles of Findings to identify duplicates.\n​ Date is meant to represent the date the Finding was uncovered by the scanner - not necessarily the date the Finding was imported into DefectDojo. This date is pulled from the scan report, but you can update this date to be more accurate if you need to (for example, if working with historical data, or if using a scanning tool which does not log discovery dates).\n​ Description is the description of a Finding provided by the scan tool. You can add or remove information from the Finding Description if you wish.\n​ Severity is calculated based on several factors. At a base level, this will be the Severity reported by a tool, but a Finding’s Severity can be affected by EPSS changes. You can also manually adjust the Finding’s Severity to an appropriate level.\n​ Tags are generic text labels that you can use to organize your Findings via Filters - or they can simply be used as shorthand to identify a specific Finding.\n​ Active / Verified are the primary Finding statuses used by a tool. Active Findings are Findings that are currently active in your network and have been reported by a tool. Verified means that this Finding has been confirmed to exist by a team member.\n​ SAST / DAST are labels used to organize your Findings into the context they were discovered in. Generally, this label is populated based on the scanning tool used, but you can adjust this to a more accurate level (for example, if the Finding was found by both a SAST and a DAST tool).

Statuses help your team keep track of their progress in resolving issues.\nEach Finding status has a context-specific meaning which will need to be defined by your own team. These are our suggestions, but your team\u0026rsquo;s usage may vary.\nActive Findings ‘This Finding has been discovered by a scanning tool.’\nBy default, any new Finding created in DefectDojo will be labeled as Active. Active in this case means ‘this is a new Finding that DefectDojo has not recorded on a past import’. If a Finding has been Mitigated in the past, but appears in a scan again in the future, the status of that Finding will reopen to reflect that the vulnerability has returned.\nVerified Findings ‘This Finding has been confirmed by our team to exist.’\nJust because a tool records a problem does not necessarily mean the Finding requires engineering attention. Therefore, new Findings are also labeled as Unverified by default.\nIf you’re able to confirm that the Finding does exist, you can mark it as Verified.\nIf you don’t need to manually verify each Finding, you can automatically mark them as Verified during import, or disregard this Status.\nOpen Findings ‘There is work to be done on these Findings.’\nOnce a Finding is Active, it will be labeled as an Open Finding, regardless of whether or not it has been Verified.\nOpen Findings can be seen from the Findings \u0026gt; Open Findings view of DefectDojo.\nClosed Findings **‘**The Vulnerability recorded here is no longer active’.\nOnce the work on a Finding is complete, you can manually Close it from the Close Findings option. Alternatively, if a scan is re-imported into DefectDojo which does not contain a previously-recorded Finding, the previously-recorded Finding will automatically close.\nUnder Review ‘I have sent this Finding to one or more team members to look at.’\nWhen a Finding is Under Review, it needs to be reviewed by a team member. You can put a Finding under review by Selecting Request Peer Review from the Finding’s drop-down menu.\nRisk Accepted ‘Our team has evaluated the risk associated with this Finding, and we’ve agreed that we can safely delay fixing it.’\nFindings cannot always be remediated or addressed for various reasons. You can add a Risk Acceptance to a Finding with the Add Risk Acceptance option. Risk Acceptances allow you to upload files and enter notes to support a Risk Acceptance decision.\nRisk Acceptances have expiry dates, at which time you can reevaluate the impact of the Finding and decide what to do next.\nOut Of Scope ‘This Finding was discovered by our scanning tool, but detecting this kind of vulnerability was not the direct goal of our test.’\nWhen you mark a Finding as Out Of Scope, you are indicating that it is not directly relevant to the Engagement or Test it is contained within.\nIf you have a testing and remediation effort related to a specific aspect of your software, you can use this Status to indicate that this Finding is not part of your effort.\nFalse Positive ‘This Finding was discovered by our scanning tool, but after reviewing the Finding we have discovered that this reported vulnerability does not exist.’\nOnce you’ve reviewed a Finding, you might discover that the vulnerability reported does not actually exist. The False Positive status allows DefectDojo to keep track of this information, and future imports will also apply the False Positive status to this Finding.\nIf a different scanning tool finds a similar Finding, it will not be recorded as a False Positive. DefectDojo can only compare Findings within the same tool to determine if a Finding has already been recorded.\nInactive ‘This Finding was discovered previously but it was either mediated or does not require immediate attention.’\nIf a Finding is marked as Inactive, this means that the issue currently has no impact on the software environment and does not need to be addressed.

The color of the tile Icon will change from Green -\u0026gt; Yellow -\u0026gt; Red as the object count changes.\nDynamic Color Minimum is the bottom of the range. If the Object count is equal to or less than this number, the tile Icon will be set to Green. Dynamic Color Maximum is the top of the range. If the Object count is equal to or greater than this number, the tile Icon will be set to Red. Any number between the Minimum or the Maximum will set the filter to Yellow. Example 1: Critical Findings Count Say you wanted to set up a Dynamic Color Tile to track our Critical Findings. You can set your Dynamic Color parameters as follows:\nSet Dynamic Color Minimum to 0. As long as you have 0 active Critical Findings, this tile will be Green. Set Dynamic Color Maximum to 5. If you have 5 or more Critical Findings active in our environment, the tile will turn Red to indicate there’s timely action required to address these Findings. If you have 1-4 Critical Findings in your instance, the filter will be Yellow to indicate that we’re not in an ‘emergency’ situation but we should be aware of these Findings. Of course, your team’s standards and acceptable range for this kind of filter may differ from our example.\nInverted Maximum and Minimum If your Maximum is lower than your Minimum, the range will still compute correctly.\nExample 2: Passing Products Count\nSay you wanted to set up a Tile which tracks your Passing Products with a Dynamic Color. An acceptable count of Passing Products for you is 5 or more, and a ‘failing’ state is 2 or fewer Passing Products.\nYou can set your Dynamic Color Maximum of 2, and a Dynamic Color Minimum of 5, the Tile will apply colors as follows:\nIf the filter returns 2 Objects or fewer , the tile will be Red, indicating that very few of your Products are passing. If the filter returns 5 Objects or greater, the tile will be Green, indicating that a healthy amount of your Products are passing. If the filter returns a value between those two numbers, the tile will be Yellow, indicating that a significant, but non-critical amount of your Products are not passing.

You’ll likely change your approach as you master the software and discover ways to optimize your workflow.\nBy default, DefectDojo does not delete any duplicate Findings that are created. Each Finding is considered to be a separate instance of a vulnerability. So in this case, Duplicate Findings can be an indicator that a process change is required to your workflow.\nStep 1: Clean up your excess Duplicates Fortunately, DefectDojo’s Deduplication settings allow you to mass-delete duplicates once a certain threshold has been crossed. This feature makes the cleanup process easier. To learn more about this process, see our article on Finding Deduplication \u0026lt;-link will go here.\nStep 2: Evaluate your Engagements for redundancies Once you’ve cleaned up your duplicate Findings, it’s a good practice to look at the Product which contained them to see if there’s a clear culprit. You might find that there are Engagements contained within which have a redundant context.\nDuplicate or Reused Engagements Engagements store one or more Tests for a particular testing context. That context is ultimately up to you to define for yourself, but if you see a few Engagements within your Product which should share the same context, consider combining them into a single engagement.\n​\nQuestions to ask when defining Engagement context: If I wanted to make a report on this work, would the Engagement contain all of the relevant information I need? Are we proactively creating Engagements ahead of time or are they being created ‘ad-hoc’ by my import process? Are we using the right kind of Engagement - Interactive or CI/CD? What section of the codebase is being worked on by tests: is each repository a separate context or could multiple repositories make up a shared context for testing? Who are the stakeholders involved with the Productt, and how will I share results with them? Step 3: Check for redundant Tests If you discover that separate Tests have been created which capture the same testing context, this may be an indicator that these tests can be consolidated into a single Reimport.\nDefectDojo has two methods for importing test data to create Findings: Import and Reimport. Both of these methods are very similar, but the key difference between the two is that Import always creates a new Test, while Reimport can add new data to an existing Test. It’s also worth noting that Reimport does not create duplicate Findings within that Test.\nEach time you import new vulnerability reports into DefectDojo, those reports will be stored in a Test object. A Test object can be created by a user ahead of time to hold a future Import. If a user wants to import data without specifying a Test destination, a new Test will be created to store the incoming report.\nTests are flexible objects, and although they can only hold one kind of report, they can handle multiple instances of that same report through the Reimport method. To learn more about Reimport, see our article on this topic.\nWhen are Duplicate Findings acceptable? Duplicate Findings are not always indicative of a problem. There are many cases where keeping duplicates is the preferred approach. For example:\nIf your team uses and reports on Interactive Engagements. If you want to create a discrete report on a single Test specifically, you would want to know if there’s an occurrence of a Finding that was already uncovered earlier. If you have Engagements which are contextually separated (for example, because they cover different repositories) you would want to be able to flag Findings which are occurring in both places.

There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. As your organization changes, having a flexible approach is key.\nDefectDojo allows you to connect your security tools in a flexible way to match those changes.\nScan Upload Methods When DefectDojo receives a vulnerability report from a security tool, it will create Findings based on the vulnerabilities contained within that report. DefectDojo acts as the central repository for these Findings where they can be triaged, remediated or otherwise addressed by you and your team.\nThere are four main ways that DefectDojo can upload Finding reports:\nVia direct import through the UI (“Add Findings”) Via API endpoint (allowing for automated data ingest) Via Connectors for certain tools, an ‘out of the box’ data integration Via Smart Upload for certain tools, an importer designed to handle infrastructure scans Comparing Upload Methods UI Import API Import Connectors Smart Upload Supported Scan Types All (see Supported Tools) All (see Supported Tools) Snyk, Semgrep, Burp Suite, AWS Security Hub, Probely, Checkmarx, Tenable Nexpose, NMap, OpenVas, Qualys, Tenable Can it be automated? Not directly, though method can be automated through API Yes, calls to API can be made manually or via script Yes, Connectors is a natively automated process which leverages your tool’s API to rapidly import data Yes, can be automated via /smart_upload_import API endpoint Product Hierarchy Each of these methods can create Product Hierarchy on the spot. Product Hierarchy refers to DefectDojo’s Product Types, Products, Engagements or Tests: objects in DefectDojo which help organize your data into relevant context.\nVulnerability data can be imported into an existing Product Hierarchy. Product Types, Products, Engagements and Tests can all be created in advance, and then data can be imported to that location in DefectDojo. The contextual Product Hierarchy can be created at the time of import. When importing a report, you can create a new Product Type, Product, Engagement and/or Test. This is handled by DefectDojo through the ‘auto-create context’ option. Next Steps If you have a brand new DefectDojo instance, learning how to use the Import Scan Form is a great starting point. If you want to learn how to translate DefectDojo’s organizational system into a robust pipeline, you can start by consulting our article on Core Data Classes. If you want to set up Connectors to work with a supported tool, see our Introducing Connectors article.

From this form, you upload a scan file from a supported tool, which will create Findings to represent those vulnerabilities. While filling out the form, you can decide whether to:\nStore these Findings under an existing Product Type / Product / Engagement or Create a new Product Type / Product / Engagement to store these Findings It’s easy to reorganize your Product Hierarchy in DefectDojo, so it’s ok if you’re not sure how to set things up yet.\nFor now, it’s good to know that Engagements can store data from multiple tools, which can be useful if you’re running different scans concurrently.\nAccessing the Import Scan Form The Import Scan form can be accessed from multiple locations:\nVia the Import \u0026gt; Add Findings menu option on the sidebar From a Product’s ‘⋮’ (horizontal dots) Menu, from a Products Table From the ⚙️Gear Menu on a Product Page Completing the Import Scan Form The Import Scan form will create a new Test nested under an Engagement, which will contain a unique Finding for each vulnerability contained within your scan file.\nThe Test will be created with a name that matches the Scan Type: e.g. a Tenable scan will be titled ‘Tenable Scan’.\nForm Options Scan File: by clicking on the Choose button, you can select a file from your computer to upload. Scan Date (optional): if you want to select a single Scan Date to be applied to all Findings that result from this import, you can select the date in this field.\nIf you do not select a Scan Date, Findings created from this report will use the date specified by the tool. SLAs for each Finding will be calculated based on their date. Scan Type: select the tool used to create this data. Product Type / Product / Engagement Name: select the Product Type, Product, and Engagement Name which you want to create a new Test under. You can also create a new Product Type, Product and/or Engagement at this time if you wish to, by entering the names of the objects that you want to create. Environment: select an Environment that corresponds to the data you’re uploading. Tags: if you want to use tags to further organize your Test data, you can add Tags using this form. Type in the name of the tag you want to create, and press Enter on your keyboard to add it to the list of tags. Process Findings Asynchronously: this field is enabled by default, but it can be disabled if you wish. See explanation below. Process Findings Asynchronously When this field is enabled, DefectDojo will use a background process to populate your Test file with Findings. This allows you to continue working with DefectDojo while Findings are being created from your scan file.\nWhen this field is disabled, DefectDojo will wait until all Findings have been successfully created before you can proceed to the next screen. This could take significant time depending on the size of your file.\nThis option is especially relevant when using the API. If uploading data with Process Findings Asynchronously turned off, DefectDojo will not return a successful response until all Findings have been created successfully,\nOptional Fields Minimum Severity: If you only want to create Findings for a particular Severity level and above, you can select the minimum Severity level here. All vulnerabilities with lower severity than this field will be ignored. Active: if you want to set all of the incoming Findings to either Active or Inactive, you can specify that here. Otherwise, DefectDojo will use the tool’s vulnerability data to determine whether the Finding is Active or Inactive. This option is relevant if you need your team to manually triage and verify Findings from a particular tool. Verified: as with Active you can set the new set of Findings to either Verified or Unverified by default. This depends on your workflow preferences. For example, if your team prefers to assume Findings are verified unless proven otherwise, you can set this field to True. Version, Branch Tag, Commit Hash, Build ID, Service can all be specified if you want to include these details in the Test. Source Code Management URI can also be specified. This form option must be a valid URI. Group By: if you want to create Finding Groups out of this File, you can specify the grouping method here.

Regardless of whether a vulnerability was reported in SonarQube, Acunetix, or your team’s custom tool, Findings give you the ability to manage each vulnerability in the same way.\nWhat are Findings? Findings in DefectDojo are made up of the following components:\nThe reported vulnerability data in question The ‘status’ of the Finding, used to track remediation, risk acceptance or other decisions made around the vulnerability Other metadata related to the Finding. For example, this could include the location of a Finding in your network, a tool’s suggestions for remediation, or links to an associated CWE or EPSS score. In addition to storing the vulnerability data and providing a remediation framework, DefectDojo also enhances your Findings in the following ways:\nAutomatically adding related EPSS scores to a Finding to describe exploitability Automatically translating a security tool’s severity metric into a Severity score for each Finding, which confers an SLA onto the Finding according to your Product’s SLA Configuration. Overall, DefectDojo Findings are designed to work with the Product Hierarchy to standardize your efforts, and apply a consistent method to each Product.\nA Finding Page The Finding Page contains various components. Each will be populated by the Import process when the Finding is created.\nThe Title of the Finding: Usually this is a descriptive shorthand which identifies the vulnerability or issue detected. This section is also where user-created Tags are displayed if they exist.\n​\nFinding Overview: This section contains five separate pages of relevant information for the Finding: Description, Mitigation, Impact, References and Notes. These fields can be populated automatically based on the incoming vulnerability data, or they can be edited by a DefectDojo user to provide additional context.\n​\n​**- Description** is a more detailed summary and explanation of the Finding in question.\n​**- Mitigation** is a suggested method for mitigating the Finding so that it is no longer present in your system.\n​**- Impact** describes the impact of the vulnerability on your security posture. This page might hold descriptive text, or it may include a CVSS Vector String, which is a shorthand way to communicate the vulnerability’s overall exploitability and with the consequences of an exploitation to your organization. Impact is closely related to a Finding’s Severity field.\n​**- References** will list any links or additional information relevant to this Finding if included.\n​**- Notes** is a page where you can record any other relevant information to this Finding. Notes are ‘DefectDojo-only’ metadata, and they are not created at the time of import. Use this field to track your mitigation progress or to add more specific detail to the Finding.\n​\nAdditional Details: This section lists other details related to this Finding, if relevant:\nRequest/Response Pairs associated with the vulnerability Steps To Reproduce the vulnerability Severity Justification where you can record a more detailed explanation of the severity or impact of the Finding.\n​\n​ Metadata: This section contains filterable metadata related to the Finding:\nID: the ID value of the Finding in DefectDojo Severity: the Severity value of the Finding. Can be Info, Low, Medium, High or Critical. Finding Severities are directly related to the Finding’s calculated SLA, based on the Product the Finding is stored in. Status: the status of the Finding. Can be either Active or Inactive. In addition to these, Findings can also have a Status of Duplicate, Mitigated, False Positive, Out Of Scope, Risk Accepted or Under Defect Review. These Statuses explain the State of the Finding in more detail. Type: this field describes how the Finding was found, either via a Static (SAST) evaluation of the source code, or through a Dynamic (DAST) evaluation of the Product as it was running. This field is defined by the tool type. Location: this field describes the related File Path to your vulnerability, if relevant. Line: this field describes the line of code containing the vulnerability, if relevant. Date Discovered: this field shows either the date the Finding was imported to DefectDojo, or the date the Finding was discovered by the Tool. Age: this calculated field shows the number of days the Finding has been active. Reporter: this is the username of the DefectDojo account who created this Finding. CWE: this field is a link to the external CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) definition which applies to this Finding. Vulnerability ID: if there is a particular ID value for this vulnerability within the tool itself, it will be tracked here. EPSS Score / Percentile: if the source data has a CWE value, DefectDojo will automatically pull an EPSS Score and Percentile (Exploit Prediction Scoring System). EPSS represents the likelihood that a software vulnerability can be exploited, based on real-world exploit data. EPSS scores are updated on an ongoing basis, using the latest exploitation data from First. Found By: This will list the scanner used to find this vulnerability.\n​ Example Finding Workflows How you work with Findings in DefectDojo depends on your team’s responsibilities within your organization. Here are some examples of these processes, and how DefectDojo can help:\nDiscover and Report vulnerabilities If you’re in charge of security reporting for many different contexts, software Products or teams, DefectDojo can report on those vulnerabilities uncovered. Using the Product Hierarchy, you can organize your Finding data into the appropriate context. For example:\nEach Product in DefectDojo can have a different SLA configuration, so that you can instantly flag Findings that are discovered in Production or other highly sensitive environments. You can create a report directly from a Product Type, Product, Engagement or Test to ‘zoom in and out’ of your security context. Tests contain results from a single tool, Engagements can combine multiple Tests, Products can contain multiple Engagements, Product Types can contain multiple Products. For more information on creating a Report, see our guides to Custom Reporting.\nTriage Vulnerabilities using Finding Status If your team needs to validate the Findings discovered, you can do so by manually applying the Verified status to Findings as you review them. You can also apply other statuses, such as:\nFalse Positive: A tool detected the threat, but the threat is not active in the environment. Out Of Scope: Active, but irrelevant to the current testing effort. Risk Accepted: Active, but determined not to be a priority to address until the Risk Acceptance expires. Under Review: may or may not be Active - your team is still investigating. Mitigated: This issue has been resolved since the Finding was created. If a tool reports a previously triaged Finding on a subsequent import, DefectDojo will remember the Finding’s previous status and update accordingly. Findings with False Positive, Out Of Scope, Risk Accepted and Under Review statuses will remain as they are, but any Finding that has been Mitigated will be reactivated to let you know that the Finding has returned to the Test environment.\nEnsure Team-wide Consensus and Accountability with Risk Acceptances Part of a security team’s responsibility is to collaborate with developers to prioritize and deprioritize security issue remediation. This is where Risk Acceptances come in. Adding a Risk Acceptance to a Finding allows you to:\nStore records and ‘artifact’ files on DefectDojo - these could be emails from colleagues acknowledging the Risk Acceptance, meeting notes, or simply a written justification for accepting the risk from your own security team. Add an expiration date to the Risk Acceptance, so that the vulnerability can be re-examined after a given period of time. Any Appsec team member understands that issue mitigation can’t be prioritized exclusively by developer teams, so Risk Acceptances help you log those sensitive decisions when they are made.\nMonitor current vulnerabilities using CWEs and EPSS scores Sometimes, the exploitability and threat posed by a known vulnerability can change based on new data. To keep your work up to date, DefectDojo has partnered with First.org to maintain a database of the latest EPSS scores related to Findings. Any Findings in DefectDojo will be kept up to date automatically according to their EPSS, which is directly based on the CWE of the Finding.\nIf a Finding’s EPSS score changes (i.e. the related Finding becomes more exploitable or less exploitable), the Severity of the Finding will adjust accordingly.\nNext Steps: Learn how to add or adjust data on your Findings through the Edit Findings menu. Learn how to update Findings in bulk using the Bulk Edit menu. Learn how to apply Risk Acceptances to Findings which create a record of sensitive decisions made surrounding risk-accepted vulnerabilities.

A Record is a connection between a DefectDojo Product and a Vendor-Equivalent-Product. You can use your Records list to control the flow of data between your tool and DefectDojo.\nRecords are created and updated during the Discover operation, which DefectDojo runs daily to look for new Vendor-Equivalent Products.\nRecords have various attributes, including:\nThe State of the Record The Product the Record imports data to When the Record was First and Last Discovered (by the Discover process) When the Record mapping was Finalized by a user A link to the DefectDojo Product How Records are Mapped Each Record needs to have a Mapping assigned. The Mapping tells DefectDojo where to store the scan data from the tool. A Mapped Record assigns the Vendor-Equivalent Product to a DefectDojo Product, and tells the Connector to start importing scan data to that location (as Engagements and Tests).\nYou can assign Mappings yourself, or you can have DefectDojo assign them automatically.\nAuto-Mapping If you have Auto-Mapping enabled, new Records will be Mapped to Products automatically. Each time DefectDojo Discovers a new Record, a matching DefectDojo Product will be automatically created for each Record**.** That Record will be stored under Mapped Records to indicate that it is ready to import data to DefectDojo.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have Auto-Mapping enabled, you can make your own decisions about where you want data to flow. Each time the Connector finds a new Vendor-Equivalent Product (via Discover), it will add a new Record to your Unmapped Records list, and you can then manually assign that Record to a new or existing Product in DefectDojo.\nMapping - Example Workflow: David has just finished setting up a connector for his BurpSuite tool, and runs a Discover operation. David has Burp set up to scan 4 different \u0026lsquo;Sites\u0026rsquo;, and DefectDojo creates a new Record for each of those Sites.\nIf David decides to use Auto-Mapping, DefectDojo will create a new Product for each Site. From now on, when DefectDojo runs a Synchronize operation, the Connector will import scan data directly from the Site into the Product (via the Record mapping)\n​ If David leaves Auto-Mapping off, DefectDojo will still discover those 4 Sites and create Records, but it won\u0026rsquo;t import any data until David creates the Mappings himself.\n​ David can always change how these mappings are set up later. Maybe he wants to consolidate the output of a few different Burp Sites into a single Product. Or maybe he\u0026rsquo;s looking to have a Product which records scan data from a few different tools - including Burp. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for David to change where Burp scan data is stored into DefectDojo by changing the Mapping of these Records. How Records interact with Products Once a Record is Mapped, DefectDojo will be ready to import your tool’s scans through a Sync Operation. Connectors can work alongside other DefectDojo import processes or interactive testing.\nRecord Mappings are designed to be non-invasive. If you map a Product to a Record which contains existing Engagements or Findings, those existing Engagements and Findings will not be affected or overwritten by the data sync process.\n​ All data created via a connector will be stored under a single Engagement called Global Connectors. That Engagement will create a separate Test for each Connector mapped to the Product.\n​ This makes it possible to send scan data from multiple Connectors to the same Product. All of the data will be stored in the same Engagement, but each Connector will store data in a separate Test.\nTo learn more about Products, Engagements and Tests, see our Core Data Classes Overview.\nRecord States - Glossary Each Record has an associated state to communicate how the Record is working.\nNew A New Record is an Unmapped Record which DefectDojo has Discovered. It can be Mapped to a Product or Ignored. To Map a new Record to a Product, see our guide on Editing Records.\nGood \u0026lsquo;Good\u0026rsquo; indicates that a Record is Mapped and operating correctly. Future Discover Operations check to see if the underlying Vendor-Equivalent Product still exists, to ensure that the Sync operation will run correctly.\nIgnored \u0026lsquo;Ignored\u0026rsquo; Records have been successfully Discovered, but a DefectDojo user has decided not to map the data to a Product. If you wish to change a New or Mapped Record to Ignored, or re-map an Ignored Record, see our guide on Editing Records.\nWarning States: Stale or Missing If the connection between tool and DefectDojo changes, the state of a Record will change to let you know.\nStale A Mapping is moved to ‘Stale’ when a related Product, Engagement or Test has been deleted from DefectDojo. The mapping still exists, but there isn’t anywhere in DefectDojo for the Tool’s data to import to.\nStale records can be remapped to an existing Product, or Ignored if the scan data is no longer relevant.\nMissing If a Record has been Mapped, but the source data (or Vendor-Equivalent Product) is not being detected by DefectDojo, the Record will be labeled as Missing.\nDefectDojo Connectors will adapt to name changes, directory changes and other data shifts, so this is possibly because the related Vendor-Equivalent Product was deleted from the Tool you’re using.\nIf you intended to remove the Vendor Equivalent Product from your tool, you can Delete a Missing Record. If not, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to troubleshoot the problem within the Tool so that the source data can be Discovered correctly.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":260,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/connectors/manage_records/","summary":"Once you have run your first Discover operation, you should see a list of Mapped or Unmapped records on the Manage Records and Operations page.","tags":[],"title":"Manage Records"},{"content":"File Types Accepts a JSON file, generated from the Mend* Unified Agent.\nSample Scan Data / Unit Tests Unit tests for Mend JSON files can be found at https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/tree/master/unittests/scans/mend\nLink To Tool See documentation: https://docs.mend.io/bundle/unified_agent/page/example_of_a_unified_agent_json_report.html\nFormerly known as Whitesource.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":261,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/mend/","summary":"File Types Accepts a JSON file, generated from the Mend* Unified Agent.\nSample Scan Data / Unit Tests Unit tests for Mend JSON files can be found at https://github.","tags":[],"title":"Mend Scan"},{"content":"The Meterian JSON report output file can be imported.\nSample Scan Data Sample Meterian Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":262,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/meterian/","summary":"The Meterian JSON report output file can be imported.\nSample Scan Data Sample Meterian Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"Meterian Scanner"},{"content":"Import XML report\nSample Scan Data Sample Microfocus Webinspect Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":263,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/microfocus_webinspect/","summary":"Import XML report\nSample Scan Data Sample Microfocus Webinspect Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"Microfocus Webinspect Scanner"},{"content":"Export a JSON file using the API, api/v1/report_json.\nSample Scan Data Sample MobSF Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":264,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/mobsf/","summary":"Export a JSON file using the API, api/v1/report_json.\nSample Scan Data Sample MobSF Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"MobSF Scanner"},{"content":"Export a JSON file using the API, api/v1/report_json.\nSample Scan Data Sample MobSF Scorecard Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":265,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/mobsf_scorecard/","summary":"Export a JSON file using the API, api/v1/report_json.\nSample Scan Data Sample MobSF Scorecard Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"MobSF Scorecard Scanner"},{"content":"Import JSON report from https://github.com/MobSF/mobsfscan\nSample Scan Data Sample Mobsfscan scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":266,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/mobsfscan/","summary":"Import JSON report from https://github.com/MobSF/mobsfscan\nSample Scan Data Sample Mobsfscan scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"Mobsfscan"},{"content":"Import JSON report.\nSample Scan Data Sample Mozilla Observatory Scanner scans can be found here.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":267,"permalink":"/en/connecting_your_tools/parsers/file/mozilla_observatory/","summary":"Import JSON report.\nSample Scan Data Sample Mozilla Observatory Scanner scans can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"Mozilla Observatory Scanner"},{"content":"This parser helps to parse Microsoft Defender Findings and supports two types of imports:\nYou can import a JSON output file from the api/vulnerabilities/machinesVulnerabilities endpoint of Microsoft defender.

At the same time, each sanitizer will have a list of issues, in this case the issues names will match to specific resources of the cluster (pods, roles, clusterroles, etc.) where each one will have inside a list of specific findings for that resource (issue in the report).\nThis parser goes through every finding inside the issues of every sanitizer looking for the ones with level 1 (Info), 2 (Warning) or 3 (Error) to be created as findings in DefectDojo.\nFindings severity matching.

You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to design a robust, adaptable workspace once you understand how these data classes can be used to organize your work.\nProduct Types The first category of data you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set up in DefectDojo is a Product Type. Product Types are intended to categorize Products in a specific way. This could be:\nby business domain by development team by security team Product Types can have Role-Based Access Control rules applied, which limit team members\u0026rsquo; ability to view and interact with their data (including any underlying Products with Engagement, Test and Finding data). For more information on user roles, see our Introduction To Roles article.\nWhat can a Product Type represent? If a particular software project has many distinct deployments or versions, it may be worth creating a single Product Type which covers the scope of the entire project, and having each version exist as individual Products.\n​ You also might consider using Product Types to represent stages in your software development process: one Product Type for \u0026lsquo;In Development\u0026rsquo;, one Product Type for \u0026lsquo;In Production\u0026rsquo;, etc.\n​ Ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s your decision how you wish to organize your Products, and what you Product Type to represent. Your DefectDojo hierarchy may need to change to fit your security teams\u0026rsquo; needs. Products A Product in DefectDojo is intended to represent any project, program, or product that you are currently testing. The Product hosts all of the security work and testing history related to the underlying goal.\nProducts always have:\na unique Name a Description a product Type an assigned SLA Configuration Products can be as broad or as specific in scope as you wish. By default, Products are completely separate objects in the hierarchy, but they can be grouped together by Product Type.\nProducts are \u0026lsquo;walled-off\u0026rsquo; and do not interact with other Products. DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Smart Features, such as Deduplication, only apply within the context of a single Product.\nLike Product Types, Products can have Role-Based Access Control rules applied, which limit team members\u0026rsquo; ability to view and interact with them (as well as any underlying Engagement, Test and Finding data). For more information on user roles, see our Introduction To Roles article.\nWhat can a Product represent? DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s concept of a \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo; will not necessarily correspond 1:1 to what your organization would refer to as a \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo;. Software development is complex, and security needs can vary greatly even within the scope of a single piece of software.\nThe following scenarios are good reasons to consider creating a separate DefectDojo Product:\n\u0026ldquo;ExampleProduct\u0026rdquo; has a Windows version, a Mac version, and a Cloud version \u0026ldquo;ExampleProduct 1.0\u0026rdquo; uses completely different software components from \u0026ldquo;ExampleProduct 2.0\u0026rdquo;, and both versions are actively supported by your company. The team assigned to work on \u0026ldquo;ExampleProduct version A\u0026rdquo; is different than the product team assigned to work on \u0026ldquo;ExampleProduct version B\u0026rdquo;, and needs to have different security permissions assigned as a result. These variations within a single Product can also be handled at the Engagement level. Note that Engagements don\u0026rsquo;t have access control in the way Products and Product Types do.\nEngagements Once a Product is set up, you can begin creating and scheduling Engagements. Engagements are meant to represent moments in time when testing is taking place, and contain one or more Tests.\nEngagements always have:\na unique Name target Start and End dates Status (Not Started, In Progress, Cancelled, Completed\u0026hellip;) an assigned Testing Lead an associated Product There are two types of Engagement: Interactive and CI/CD.\nAn Interactive Engagement is typically run by an engineer. Interactive Engagements are focused on testing the application while the app is running, using an automated test, human tester, or any activity “interacting” with the application functionality. See OWASP\u0026rsquo;s definition of IAST. A CI/CD Engagement is for automated integration with a CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD Engagements are meant to import data as an automated action, triggered by a step in the release process. Engagements can be tracked using DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Calendar view.\nWhat can an Engagement represent? Engagements are meant to represent groups of related testing efforts. How you wish to group your testing efforts depends on your approach.\nIf you have a planned testing effort scheduled, an Engagement offers you a place to store all of the related results. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of this kind of Engagement:\nEngagement: ExampleSoftware 1.5.2 - Interactive Testing Effort In this example, a security team runs multiple tests on the same day as part of a software release.\nTest: Nessus Scan Results (March 12) Test: NPM Scan Audit Results (March 12) Test: Snyk Scan Results (March 12)\n​ You can also organize CI/CD Test results within an Engagement. These kinds of Engagements are \u0026lsquo;Open-Ended\u0026rsquo; meaning that they don\u0026rsquo;t have a date, and will instead add additional data each time the associated CI/CD actions are run.\nEngagement: ExampleSoftware CI/CD Testing In this example, multiple CI/CD scans are automatically imported as Tests every time a new software release is created.\nTest: 1.5.2 Scan Results (March 12) Test: 1.5.1 Scan Results (March 3) Test: 1.5.0 Scan Results (February 14) Engagements can be organized however works best for your team. All Engagements nested under a Product can be viewed by the team assigned to work on the Product.\nTests Tests are a grouping of activities conducted by engineers to attempt to discover flaws in a product.\nTests always have:\na unique Test Title a specific **Test Type (**API Test, Nessus Scan, etc) an associated test Environment an associated Engagement Tests can be created in different ways. Scan data can be directly imported to an Engagement, which will then create a new Test containing that data. Tests can also be created in advance without scan data, as part of planning future Engagements.\nHow do Tests interact with each other? Tests take your testing data and group it into Findings. Generally, security teams will be running the same testing effort repeatedly, and Tests in DefectDojo allow you to handle this process in an elegant way.\nPreviously imported tests can be reimported - If you\u0026rsquo;re running the same type of test within the same Engagement context, you can Reimport the test results after each completed scan. DefectDojo will compare the Reimported data to the existing result, and will not create new Findings if duplicates exist in the scan data.\nTests can be imported separately - If you run the same test on a Product within separate Engagements, DefectDojo will still compare the data with previous Tests to find duplicate Findings. This allows you to keep track of previously mitigated or risk-accepted Findings.\nIf a Test is added directly to a Product without an Engagement, a generic Engagement will be created automatically to contain the Test. This allows for ad-hoc data imports.\nExamples of Tests:\nBurp Scan from Oct. 29, 2015 to Oct. 29, 2015 Nessus Scan from Oct. 31, 2015 to Oct. 31, 2015 API Test from Oct. 15, 2015 to Oct. 20, 2015 Findings Once data has been added uploaded to a Test, the results of that data will be listed in the Test as individual Findings for review.\nA finding represents a specific flaw discovered while testing.\nFindings always have:\na unique Finding Name the Date they were uncovered multiple associated Statuses, such as Active, Verified or False Positive an associated Test a Severity level: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational (Info). Findings can be added through a data import, but they can also be added manually to a Test.\nExamples of Findings:\nOpenSSL ‘ChangeCipherSpec’ MiTM Potential Vulnerability Web Application Potentially Vulnerable to Clickjacking Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled ","date":"0001-01-01","id":293,"permalink":"/en/working_with_findings/organizing_engagements_tests/product-hierarchy-overview/","summary":"DefectDojo uses five main data classes to organize your work: Product Types, Products, Engagements, Tests, and Findings.\nDefectDojo is made to be flexible to conform to your team, rather than making your team conform to the tool.","tags":[],"title":"Product Hierarchy: Overview"},{"content":"This parser imports the Progpilot SAST JSON output.

You can also create Full Risk Acceptances, which are objects stored in DefectDojo to capture a risk acceptance decision made by your team. A Full Risk Acceptance is a special object in DefectDojo, used when Active Findings are ‘backlogged’ by your team. Often, both security teams and developer teams will decide when a Risk Acceptance is appropriate. In DefectDojo, your team can create Risk Acceptances which capture the internal decision making process and can be used as a source of truth.\nAbout Full Risk Acceptances Each Full Risk Acceptance can store details about the following:\nThe Security team’s recommendation to a Product owner or other stakeholder Description of the decision made by stakeholders The DefectDojo user involved in the decision making process One or more Findings governed by the Risk Acceptance Findings can be added to a Risk Acceptance regardless of the Product, Test or Engagement they are in.\nAny Findings associated with a Full Risk Acceptance will be set to Inactive, Risk Accepted.\nGenerally, any Risk Acceptances should follow your internal security policy and be re-examined at an appropriate time. As a result, Risk Acceptances also have expiration dates. Once a Risk Acceptance expires, any Findings will be set to Active again.\nAdding a new Full Risk Acceptance Risk Acceptances can be added to a Finding in two ways:\nUsing the Bulk Edit menu, when looking at a list of Findings Using the Add Risk Acceptance button on an individual Finding ##\nTo create a New Risk Acceptance, complete the Add to New Risk Acceptance form on a Finding you wish to Risk Accept.\n1. Create a Name for the Risk Acceptance. 2. Select the Owner of the Risk Acceptance - this is generally meant to be the DefectDojo team member responsible for the decision to Risk Accept the Finding 3. Complete the Optional Fields with any relevant information. If you want to set an Expiration Date or a Warning for that Expiration Date, you can do so here as well. If you don’t specify a date, the Default Risk Acceptance / Default Risk Acceptance Expiration days will be used from the System Settings page. 4. Select whether you want to Reactivate or Restart SLAs on any associated Findings once the Risk Acceptance expires.\nSimple Risk Acceptances If you don’t want to create a Full Risk Acceptance object and would prefer to simply apply a status of ‘Risk Accepted’ to a Finding, you can do so through the Bulk Edit menu. This method is called Simple Risk Acceptance.\nBefore you can apply a Simple Risk Acceptance to a Finding, Simple Risk Acceptance will need to be enabled at the Product level. This setting can be found on the Edit Product Form.\nApplying a Simple Risk Acceptance With one or more Findings selected, open Bulk Update Actions. Navigate to Simple Risk Acceptance Status and select either Accept Risk or Unaccept Risk. Once you have submitted the Bulk Update, ‘Risk Accepted’ will be applied to any Findings selected without the need to create a Risk Acceptance object (with an expiration date or additional metadata).\nLocating Risk Accepted Findings The sidebar in DefectDojo allows you to quickly find any Risk Accepted Findings by opening Manage \u0026gt; Risk Acceptances.

This allows them to view and interact with Data Types (Product Types, Products, Engagements, Tests and Findings) in DefectDojo depending on the role they are assigned on the specific Product. Users can have multiple Product or Product Type memberships, with different levels of access.\n​ Users can also have Configuration Permissions assigned, which allow them to access configuration pages in DefectDojo. Configuration Permissions are not related to Products or Product Types.\n​ Users can be assigned Global Roles, which give them a standardized level of access to all Products and Product Types.\n​ Users can be set up as Superusers: administrator level roles which give them control and access to all DefectDojo data and configuration. You can also create Groups if you want to assign Product Membership, Configuration Permissions or Global Roles to a group of users at the same time. If you have a large number of users in DefectDojo, such as a dedicated testing team for a particular Product, Groups may be a more helpful feature.\nSuperusers \u0026amp; Global Roles Part of your Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration may require you to create additional Superusers, or users with Global Roles.\nSuperusers (Admins) have no limitations in the system. They can change all settings, manage users and have read / write access to all data. They can also change access rules for all users in DefectDojo. Superusers will also receive notifications for all system issues and alerts. Users with Global Roles can view and interact with any Data Type (Product Types, Products, Engagements, Tests and Findings) in DefectDojo depending on their assigned Role. For more information about each Role and associated privileges, please refer to our Introduction to Roles article. Users can also have specific Configuration Permissions assigned, allowing them to access certain DefectDojo configuration pages. Users have no Configuration Permissions by default. By default, the first account created on a new DefectDojo instance will have Superuser permissions. That user will be able to edit permissions for all subsequent DefectDojo users. Only an existing Superuser can add another superuser, or add a Global Role to a user.\nAdd Superuser or Global Role status to an existing user Navigate to the 👤 Users \u0026gt; Users page on the sidebar. You will see a list of all registered accounts on DefectDojo, along with each account\u0026rsquo;s Active status, Global Roles, and other relevant User data.\n​ ​ 2. Click the name of the account that you wish to give Superuser privileges to. This will bring you to their User Page.\n​ 3. From the Default Information section of their User Page, open the ☰ menu and select Edit.\n​\n​ 4. From the Edit User page:\n​\nFor Superuser Status, check off the ☑️Superuser Status box, located in the user\u0026rsquo;s Default Information.\n​\nTo assign a Global Role, select one from the dropdown Global Role menu at the bottom of the page.\n​\n​ 5. Click Submit to accept these changes.\n​\nProduct \u0026amp; Product Type Membership By default, any new account created on DefectDojo will not have permission to view any Product Level Data. They will need to be assigned membership to each Product they want to view and interact with.\nProduct \u0026amp; Product Type membership can only be configured by Superusers, Maintainers or Owners. Maintainers \u0026amp; Owners can only configure membership on Products / Product Types that they are already assigned to. Global Maintainers \u0026amp; Owners can configure membership on any Product or Product Type, as can Superusers. Users can have two kinds of membership simultaneously at the Product level:\nThe Role conferred by their underlying Product Type membership, if applicable Their Product-specific Role, if one exists. If a user has already been added as a Product Type member, and does not require an additional level of permissions on a specific Product, there is no need to add them as a Product Member.\nAdding a new Member to a Product or Product Type Navigate to the Product or Product Type which you want to assign a user to. You can select the Product from the list under Products \u0026gt; All Products. 2. Locate the Members heading, click the ☰ menu, and select + Add Users. 3. This will take you to a page where you can Register new Members. Select a User from the dropdown Users menu. 4. Select the Role that you want that User to have on this Product or Product Type: API Importer, Reader, Writer, Maintainer or Owner.\n​\nUsers cannot be assigned as Members on a Product or Product Type without also having a Role. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure which Role you want a new user to have, Reader is a good \u0026lsquo;default\u0026rsquo; option. This will keep your Product state secure until you make your final decision about their Role.\nEdit Or Delete a Member from a Product or Product Type Members can have their Role changed within a Product or Product Type.\nWithin the Product or Product Type page, navigate to the Members heading and click the ⋮ button next to the User who you want to Edit or Delete.\n📝 Edit will take you to the Edit Member screen, where you can change this user\u0026rsquo;s Role (from API Importer, Reader, Writer, Maintainer or Owner to a different choice).\n🗑️ Delete removes a User\u0026rsquo;s Membership altogether. It will not remove any contributions or changes the User has made to the Product or Product Type.\nIf you can\u0026rsquo;t Edit or Delete a user\u0026rsquo;s Membership (the ⋮ is not visible) it\u0026rsquo;s because they have this Membership conferred at a Product Type level. A user can have two levels of membership within a Product - one assigned at the Product Type level and another assigned at the Product level. Adding an additional Product role to a user with a related Product Type role If a User has a Product Type-level Role, they will also be assigned Membership with this Role to every underlying Product within the category. However, if you want this User to have a special Role on a specific Product within that Product Type, you can give them an additional Role on the Product level.\nFrom the Product page, navigate to the Members heading, click the ☰ menu, and select + Add Users (as if you were adding a new User to the Product). Select the User\u0026rsquo;s name from the drop-down menu, and select the Product Role you want that User to be assigned. A Product Role will supersede a user’s standard Product Type Role or Global Role. For example, if a User has a Product Type Role of Reader, but is also assigned as an Owner on a Product nested under that Product Type, they will have additional Owner permissions added for that Product only.\nHowever, this does not work in reverse. If a User has a Product Type Role or Global Role of Owner, assigning them a Reader role on a particular Product will not take away their Owner permissions. Roles cannot take away permissions granted to a User by other Roles, they can only add additional permissions.\nConfiguration Permissions Many configuration dialogues and API endpoints can be enabled for users or groups of users, regardless of their superuser status. These Configuration Permissions allow regular users to access and contribute to parts of DefectDojo outside of their standard Product or Product Role assignment.\nConfiguration Permissions are not related to a specific Product or Product Type - users can have configuration permissions assigned without the need for other statuses or Product / Product Type Membership.\n​\nList of Configuration Permissions Credential Manager: Access to the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Credential Manager page Development Environments: Manage the Engagements \u0026gt; Environments list Finding Templates: Access to the Findings \u0026gt; Finding Templates page Groups: Access the 👤Users \u0026gt; Groups page Jira Instances: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; JIRA page Language Types:Access the Language Types API endpoint Login Banner: Edit the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Login Banner page Announcements: Access ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Announcements Note Types: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Note Types page Product Types: n/a Questionnaires: Access the Questionnaires \u0026gt; All Questionnaires page Questions: Access the Questionnaires \u0026gt; Questions page Regulations: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Regulations page SLA Configuration: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; SLA Configuration page Test Types: Add or edit a Test Type (under Engagements \u0026gt; Test Types) Tool Configuration: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Tool Types page Tool Types: Access the ⚙️Configuration \u0026gt; Tool Types page Users: Access the 👤Users \u0026gt; Users page Add Configuration Permissions to a User Only Superusers can add Configuration Permissions to a User.\nNavigate to the 👤 Users \u0026gt; Users page on the sidebar.

This is relevant in an Infrastructure scanning context, where the Findings may apply to many different teams, have different implicit SLAs, or need to be included in separate reports due to where they were discovered in your infrastructure.\nSmart Upload handles this by sorting incoming findings based on the Endpoints discovered in the scan. At first, those Findings will need to be manually assigned, or directed into the correct Product from an Unassigned Findings list. However, once a Finding has been assigned to a Product, all subsequent Findings that share an Endpoint or Host will be sent to the same Product.\nSmart Upload menu options The Smart Upload menu is stored in a collapsible section of the sidebar.\nAdd Findings allows you to import a new scan file, similar to DefectDojo’s Import Scan method Unassigned Findings lists all Findings from Smart Upload which have yet to be assigned to a Product. The Smart Upload Form The Smart Upload Import Scan form is essentially the same as the Import Scan form. See our notes on the Import Scan Form for more details.\nUnassigned Findings Once a Smart Upload has been completed, any Findings which are not automatically assigned to a Product (based on their Endpoint) will be placed in the Unassigned Findings list. The first Smart Upload for a given tool does not yet have any method to Assign Findings, so each Finding from this file will be sent to this page for sorting.\nUnassigned Findings are not included in the Product Hierarchy and will not appear in reports, filters or metrics until they have been assigned.\nWorking with Unassigned Findings You can select one or more Unassigned Findings for sorting with the checkbox, and perform one of the following actions:\nAssign to New Product, which will create a new Product Assign to Existing Product which will move the Finding into an existing Product Disregard Selected Findings, which will remove the Finding from the list Whenever a Finding is assigned to a New or Existing Product, it will be placed in a dedicated Engagement called ‘Smart Upload’. This Engagement will contain a Test named according to the Scan Type (e.g. Tenable Scan). Subsequent Findings uploaded via Smart Upload which match those Endpoints will be placed under that Engagement \u0026gt; Test.\nDisregarded Findings If a Finding is Disregarded it will be removed from the Unassigned Findings list.

At a base level, you\u0026rsquo;ll need:\nLocation -a field whichgenerallyrefers to your tool\u0026rsquo;s URL in your network, Secret - generally an API key. Some tools will require additional API-related fields beyond Location and Secret. They may also require you to make changes on their side to accommodate an incoming Connector from DefectDojo.\nEach tool has different API requirements, and this guide is intended to help you set up the tool\u0026rsquo;s API so that DefectDojo can connect.\nWhenever possible, we recommend creating a new \u0026lsquo;DefectDojo Bot\u0026rsquo; account within your Security Tool which will only be used by the Connector. This will help you better differentiate between actions manually taken by your team, and automated actions taken by the Connector.\nSupported Connectors AWS Security Hub The AWS Security Hub connector uses an AWS access key to interact with the Security Hub APIs.\nPrerequisites Rather than use the AWS access key from a team member, we recommend creating an IAM User in your AWS account specifically for DefectDojo, with that user\u0026rsquo;s permissions limited to those necessary for interacting with Security Hub.\nAWS\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;**AWSSecurityHubReadOnlyAccess**policy\u0026rdquo; provides the required level of access for a connector. If you would like to write a custom policy for a Connector, you will need to include the following permissions:\nDescribeHub GetFindingAggregator GetFindings ListFindingAggregators A working policy definition might look like the following:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AWSSecurityHubConnectorPerms\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;securityhub:DescribeHub\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;securityhub:GetFindingAggregator\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;securityhub:GetFindings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;securityhub:ListFindingAggregators\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] }\rPlease note: we may need to use additional API actions in the future to provide the best possible experience, which will require updates to this policy.\nOnce you have created your IAM user and assigned it the necessary permissions using an appropriate policy/role, you will need to generate an access key, which you can then use to create a Connector.\nConnector Mappings Enter the appropriate AWS API Endpoint for your region in the Location field**:** for example, to retrieve results from the us-east-1 region, you would supply https://securityhub.us-east-1.amazonaws.com 2. Enter a valid AWS Access Key in the Access Key field. 3. Enter a matching Secret Key in the Secret Key field.\nDefectDojo can pull Findings from more than one region using Security Hub\u0026rsquo;s cross-region aggregation feature. If cross-region aggregation is enabled, you should supply the API endpoint for your \u0026ldquo;Aggregation Region\u0026rdquo;. Additional linked regions will have ProductRecords created for them in DefectDojo based on your AWS account ID and the region name.\nBurpSuite DefectDojo’s Burp connector calls Burp’s GraphQL API to fetch data.\nPrerequisites Before you can set up this connector, you will need an API key from a Burp Service Account. Burp user accounts don’t have API keys by default, so you may need to create a new user specifically for this purpose.\nSee Burp Documentation for a guide on setting up a Service Account user with an API key.\nConnector Mappings Enter Burp’s root URL in the Location field: this is the URL where you access the Burp tool. Enter a valid API Key in the Secret field. This is the API key associated with your Burp Service account. See the official Burp documentation for more information on the Burp API.\nCheckmarx ONE DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Checkmarx ONE connector calls the Checkmarx API to fetch data.\nConnector Mappings Enter your Tenant Name in the Checkmarx Tenant field. This name should be visible on the Checkmarx ONE login page in the top-right hand corner:\n\u0026quot; Tenant: \u0026lt;your tenant name\u0026gt; \u0026quot;\n​ 2. Enter a valid API key. You may need to generate a new one: see Checkmarx API Documentation for details. 3. Enter your tenant location in the Location field. This URL is formatted as follows:\n​https://\u0026lt;your-region\u0026gt;.ast.checkmarx.net/ . Your Region can be found at the beginning of your Checkmarx URL when using the Checkmarx app. https://ast.checkmarx.net is the primary US server (which has no region prefix).\nDependency-Track This connector fetches data from a on-premise Dependency-Track instance, via REST API.\n​Connector Mappings\nEnter your local Dependency-Track server URL in the Location field. Enter a valid API key in the Secret field. To generate a Dependency-Track API key:\nAccess Management: Navigate to Administration \u0026gt; Access Management \u0026gt; Teams in the Dependency-Track interface. Teams Setup: You can either create a new team or select an existing one. Teams allow you to manage API access based on group membership. Generate API Key: In the selected team\u0026rsquo;s details page, find the \u0026ldquo;API Keys\u0026rdquo; section. Click the + button to generate a new API key. Assign Permissions: In the \u0026ldquo;Permissions\u0026rdquo; section of the team\u0026rsquo;s page, click the + button to open the permissions selector. Choose VIEW_PORTFOLIO and VIEW_VULNERABILITY permissions to enable API access to project portfolios and vulnerability details. Click \u0026ldquo;Select\u0026rdquo; to confirm and save these permissions. For more information, see Dependency-Track Documentation.\nProbely This connector uses the Probely REST API to fetch data.\n​Connector Mappings\nEnter the appropriate API server address in the Location field. (either https://api.us.probely.com/ or https://api.eu.probely.com/ ) Enter a valid API key in the Secret field. You can find an API key under the User \u0026gt; API Keys menu in Probely.\nSee Probely documentation for more info.\nSemGrep This connector uses the SemGrep REST API to fetch data.\nConnector Mappings Enter https://semgrep.dev/api/v1/in the Location field.\nEnter a valid API key in the Secret field. You can find this on the Tokens page:\n​\n\u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; in the left navbar \u0026gt; Tokens \u0026gt; Create new token (https://semgrep.dev/orgs/-/settings/tokens) See SemGrep documentation for more info.\nSonarQube The SonarQube Connector can fetch data from either a SonarCloud account or from a local SonarQube instance.\nFor SonarCloud users:\nEnter https://sonarcloud.io/ in the Location field. Enter a valid API key in the Secret field. For SonarQube (on-premise) users:\nEnter the base url of your SonarQube instance in the Location field: for example https://my.sonarqube.com/ Enter a valid API key in the Secret field. This will need to be a User API Token Type. API tokens can be found and generated via My Account -\u0026gt; Security -\u0026gt; Generate Token in the SonarQube app. For more information, see SonarQube documentation.\nSnyk The Snyk connector uses the Snyk REST API to fetch data.\nConnector Mappings Enter https://api.snyk.io/rest or https://api.eu.snyk.io/rest (for a regional EU deployment) in the Location field. Enter a valid API key in the Secret field. API Tokens are found on a user\u0026rsquo;s Account Settings page in Snyk. See the Snyk API documentation for more info.\nTenable The Tenable connector uses the Tenable.io REST API to fetch data.\nOn-premise Tenable Connectors are not available at this time.\nConnector Mappings Enter https://cloud.tenable.com in the Location field. Enter a valid API key in the Secret field.

Each Custom Field will only be created from DefectDojo with a default value.\nJira Cloud now allows you to create a default Custom Field value directly in-app. See Atlassian\u0026rsquo;s documentation on Custom Fields for more information on how to configure this.\nDefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s built-in Jira Issue Types (Bug, Task, Story and Epic) are set up to work \u0026lsquo;out of the box\u0026rsquo;. Data fields in DefectDojo will automatically map to the corresponding fields in Jira. By default, DefectDojo will assign Priority, Labels and a Reporter to any new Issue it creates.\nSome Jira configurations require additional custom fields to be accounted for before an issue can be created. This process will allow you to account for these custom fields in your DefectDojo -\u0026gt; Jira integration, ensuring that issues are created successfully. These custom fields will be added to any API calls sent from DefectDojo to a linked Jira instance.\nIf you don’t already use Custom Fields in Jira, there is no need to follow this process.\nProcess Summary Recording the names of your Custom Fields in Jira (Jira UI) Determine the Key values for the new Custom Fields (Jira Field Spec Endpoint) Locate the acceptable data for each Custom Field, using the Key values as a reference (Jira Issue Endpoint) Create a Field Reference JSON block to track all of the Custom Field Keys and acceptable data (Jira Issue Endpoint) Store the JSON block in the associated DefectDojo Product, to allow Custom Fields to be created from Jira (DefectDojo UI) Test your work and ensure that all required data is flowing from Jira properly Step 1: Record the names of your Custom Fields in Jira Jira supports a variety of different Context Fields, including Date Pickers, Custom Labels, Radio Buttons. Each of these Context Fields will have a different Key value that can be found in the Jira API.\nWrite down the names of each required Custom Field, as you will need to search through the Jira API to find them in the next step.\nExample of a Custom Field list (your Custom Field names will be different):\nDefectDojo Custom URL Field Another example of a Custom Field \u0026hellip; Step 2: Finding your Jira Custom Field Key Values Start this process by navigating to the Field Spec URL for your entire Jira instance.\nHere is an example of a Field Spec URL:\nhttps://yourcompany-example.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/field\nThe API will return a long string of JSON, which should be formatted into readable text (using a code editor, browser extension or https://jsonformatter.org/).\nThe JSON returned from this URL will contain all of your Jira custom fields, most of which are irrelevant to DefectDojo and have values of “Null”. Each object in this API response corresponds to a different field in Jira. You will need to search for the objects that have “name” attributes which match the names of each Custom Field you created in the Jira UI, and then note the value of their “key” attribute.\n⬆ Here is an example of a Custom URL Field on an issue, how the Custom URL Field appears in the JSON output.\nOnce you’ve found the matching object in the JSON output, you can determine the “key” value - in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s customfield_10050.\nJira generates different key values for each Custom Field, but these key values do not change once created. If you create another Custom Field in the future, it will have a new key value.\nExpanding our Custom Field list:\n“DefectDojo Custom URL Field” = customfield_10050 “Another example of a Custom Field” = customfield_12345 \u0026hellip; Step 3 - Finding the Custom Fields on a Jira Issue Locate an Issue in Jira that contains the Custom Fields which you recorded in Step 2. Copy the Issue Key for the title (should look similar to “EXAMPLE-123”) and navigate to the following URL:\nhttps://yourcompany-example.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EXAMPLE-123\nThis will return another string of JSON.\nAs before, API output will contain lots of customfield_## object parameters with null values - these are custom fields that Jira adds by default, which aren’t relevant to this issue. It will also contain customfield_## values that match the Custom Field Key values that you found in the previous step. Unlike with the Field Spec output, you won’t see names identifying any of these custom fields, which is why you needed to record the key values in Step 2.\nExample:\nWe know that customfield_10050 represents the DefectDojo Custom URL Field because we recorded it in Step 2. We can now see that customfield_10050 contains a value of “https://google.com” in the EXAMPLE-123 issue.\nStep 4 - Creating a JSON Field Reference from each Jira Custom Field Key You’ll now need to take the value of each of the Custom Fields from your list and store them in a JSON object (to use as a reference). You can ignore any Custom Fields that don’t correspond to your list.\nThis JSON object will contain all of the default values for new Jira Issues. We recommend using names that are easy for your team to recognize as ‘default’ values that need to be changed: ‘change-me.com’, ‘Change this paragraph.’ etc.\nExample:\nFrom step 3, we now know that Jira expects a URL string for \u0026ldquo;customfield_10050”. We can use this to build our example JSON object.\nSay we had also located a DefectDojo-related short text field, which we identified as \u0026ldquo;customfield_67890”. We would look at this field in our second API output, look at the associated value, and reference the stored value in our example JSON object as well.\n​\nYour JSON object will start to look like this as you add more Custom Fields to it.\n{ \u0026#34;customfield_10050\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://change-me.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customfield_67890\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is the short text custom field.\u0026#34; }\rRepeat this process until all of the DefectDojo-relevant custom fields from Jira have been added to your JSON Field Reference.\nData types \u0026amp; Jira Syntax Some fields, such as Date fields, may relate to multiple custom fields in Jira. If that is the case, you’ll need to add both fields to your JSON Field Reference.\n\u0026#34;customfield_10040\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1970-01-01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customfield_10041\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1970-01-01T03:30:00.000+0200\u0026#34;,\rOther fields, such as the Label field, may be tracked as a list of strings - please make sure your JSON Field Reference uses a format that matches API output from Jira.\n// a list of custom labels on a Jira object \u0026#34;customfield_10042\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;custom-label-one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;this-is-default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;change-me-please\u0026#34; ],\rOther custom fields may contain additional, contextual information that should be removed from the Field Reference. For example, the Custom Multichoice Field contains an extra block in the API output, which you’ll need to remove, as this block stores the current value of the field.\nyou should remove the extra object from this field: \u0026#34;customfield_10047\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;self\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example.url...\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example ID\u0026#34; } ]\rinstead, you can shorten this to the following and disregard the second part: \u0026#34;customfield_10047\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; } ] Example Completed Field Reference Here is a complete JSON Field Reference, with in-line comments explaining what each custom field pertains to. This is meant as an all-encompassing example. Your JSON will contain different key values and data points depending on the Custom Values you want to use during issue creation.\n{ \u0026#34;customfield_10050\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://change-me.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customfield_10049\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a short text custom field\u0026#34;, // two different fields, but both correspond to the same custom date attribute \u0026#34;customfield_10040\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1970-01-01\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customfield_10041\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1970-01-01T03:30:00.000+0200\u0026#34;, // a list of custom labels on a Jira object \u0026#34;customfield_10042\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;custom-label-one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;this-is-default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;change-me-please\u0026#34; ], // custom number field \u0026#34;customfield_10043\u0026#34;: 0, // custom paragraph field \u0026#34;customfield_10044\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a very long winded way to say CHANGE ME PLEASE\u0026#34;, // custom radio button field \u0026#34;customfield_10045\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;radio button option\u0026#34; }, // custom multichoice field \u0026#34;customfield_10047\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; } ], // custom checkbox field \u0026#34;customfield_10039\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;A\u0026#34; } ], // custom select list (singlechoice) field \u0026#34;customfield_10048\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } }\rStep 5 - Adding the Custom Fields to a DefectDojo Product You can now add these custom fields to the associated DefectDojo Product, in the Custom Fields section. Once again,\nNavigate to Edit Product - defectdojo.com/product/ID/edit . Navigate to Custom fields and paste the JSON Field Reference as plain text in the Custom Fields box. Click ‘Submit’. Step 6 - Testing your Jira Custom Fields from a new Finding: Now, when you create a new Finding in the Jira-associated Product, Jira will automatically create all of these Custom Fields in Jira according to the JSON block contained within. These Custom Fields will be created with the default (“change-me-please”, etc.) values.\nWithin the Product on DefectDojo, navigate to the Findings \u0026gt; Add New Finding page. Make sure the Finding is both Active and Verified to ensure that it pushes to Jira, and then confirm on the Jira side that the Custom Fields are successfully created without any inconsistencies.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":347,"permalink":"/en/jira_integration/using-custom-fields/","summary":"DefectDojo does not currently support passing any Issue-specific information into these Custom Fields - these fields will need to be updated manually in Jira after the issue is created.","tags":[],"title":"Using Custom Fields in Jira"},{"content":"Logging into DefectDojo\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Manager allows you to configure your account settings and manage your subscription with DefectDojo Cloud.\nNew Subscription This page allows you to request a new, or additional Cloud instance from DefectDojo.\nManage Subscriptions The Subscription Management page shows all of your currently active Cloud instances, and allows you to configure the Firewall settings for each instance.\nTo edit or add firewall rules from within the DefectDojo cloud site, navigate to the Manage Subscriptions page, then click the Edit Subscription button in the top right corner of the subscription you wish to edit.\nOnce on the Edit Subscription page, enter the IP Address, Mask, and Label for the rule you wish to add.

Custom Reports can include branding and boilerplate text, and can also be used as Templates for future reports.\nOpening the Report Builder The Report Builder can be opened from the 📄Reports page on the sidebar.\nThe report builder page is organized in two columns. The left Report Format column is where you can design your report, using widgets from the right Available Widgets column.\nStep 1: Set Report Options From the Report Options section, you can take the following actions:\nSet a Report Name for the Report or Template Include user-created Finding Notes in the report Include Finding Images in the report Upload a header Image to the report Select a header image for your report To add an image to the top of your report, click the Choose File button and upload an image to DefectDojo.\nThe image will automatically resize to fit the document, and will render directly above your Report Name.\nStep 2: Add content to your report with Widgets Once you have set your Report Options, you can begin to design your report using DefectDojo’s widgets.\nWidgets are content elements of a report which can be added by dragging and dropping them into the Report Format column. The final Report will be generated based on the position of each Widget, with the Report Name and Header Image rendered at the top.\nThe elements of your report can be reordered by dragging and dropping your widgets into a new order. To remove a widget from a report, click and drag it back to the right column. Widgets can also be collapsed by clicking on the grey header, for ease in navigation through a report builder. The Findings Widget, WYSIWYG Widget and the Endpoints widget can be used more than once. Cover Page Widget The Cover Page Widget allows you to set a Heading, Sub heading and additional metadata for your report. You can only have a single Cover Page for a given Report.\nExecutive Summary Widget The Executive Summary widget is intended to summarize your report at a glance. It contains a Heading (defaults to Executive Summary), as well as a text box which can contain whatever information you feel is required to summarize the report.\nYou can also Include SLAs in your executive summary. To add images, markup formatting or anything beyond pure text, consider adding a WYSIWYG Content Widget immediately after the executive summary.\nYou can only have a single Executive Summary for a given Report. If your Report contains multiple SLA configurations (I.E. you have Findings from separate Products which each have their own standards for SLA) each SLA configuration will be listed on the Executive Summary as a separate row. Severities Widget As each organization will have different definitions for each severity level, the Severities Widget allows you to define the Severity Levels used in your report for ease of understanding.\nTable Of Contents Widget The Table Of Contents Widget creates a list of each Finding in your report, for quicker access to specific Findings. The table of contents will create a separate heading for each Severity contained within the report. Each Finding listed in the table of contents will have an anchor link attached to quickly jump to the Finding in the report.\n* Set an optional Heading for your Table Of Contents if you wish.\nYou can add a section of Custom Content, which will add text underneath the Heading. You can upload an image to the Table Of Contents by clicking the Choose File button next to the Image line. The uploaded image will render directly above the Heading selected. Images will be resized to fit the document. WYSIWYG Content Widget The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) widget can be used to add a section containing text and images in your report. Multiple copies of this Widget can be added to add context to other sections of your report.\nWYSIWYG Content can include an optional Heading. Images can be added to a WYSIWYG widget by dragging and dropping them directly into the Content box. Images inserted into the Content box will render at their full resolution. You can add multiple WYSIWYG widgets to a report. Findings Widget The Findings Widget provides a list and summary of each Finding you want to include in your report. You can set the scope of the Findings you wish to include with Filters.\nThe Findings Widget is divided into two sections. The upper section contains a list of filters which can be used to determine which Findings you want to include, and the lower section contains the resulting list of Findings after filters are applied.\nTo apply filters to your Findings widget, set the filter parameters and click the Apply Filter button at the bottom. You can preview the results of your filter by checking the Findings list located underneath the Filters section.\n* The resulting list of Findings will be split up into sections by Severity Level. Note that DefectDojo data model components (Test, Engagement or Product) will not be represented in the report, only a list of Findings.\nAs with Widgets, the Filters section can be expanded and collapsed by clicking the gret Filters header. You can add multiple separate Findings Widgets to your report with different filter parameters if you want the report to contain more than one list of Findings. Only the Findings you are authorized to view are included in these listings, with respect to Role-Based Access Control Example Rendered Finding List Vulnerable Endpoints Widget The Vulnerable Endpoints widget is similar to the Findings widget. You can use this widget to list all Findings for specific Endpoints, and sort the Finding list by Endpoint instead of by Severity level.\nThe Vulnerable Endpoints widget will list each active Finding for the Endpoints selected. Rather than creating a single list of unsorted Findings this feature will separate them into their Endpoint context.\nAs with the Findings Widget, the Vulnerable Endpoints Widget is divided into a Filter section and a list of resulting Endpoints from the filter parameters.\nSelect the parameters for the Endpoints you wish to include here and click the Apply Findings button at the bottom. You can preview the results of your filter by checking the Endpoints list located underneath the Filters section.\nYou can add multiple separate Vulnerable Widgets to your report with different filter parameters if you want the report to contain more than one list. Only the Findings you are authorized to view are included in these listings, with respect to Role-Based Access Control. -------------- (separator) Widget This Widget will render a light grey horizontal line to divide between sections.\nStep 3: Publishing and viewing your Report Once you have finished building your report, you can generate it by clicking the green ‘Run’ button at the bottom of the Report Format section.\nThis will automatically take you to the Generated Reports page, and your report will begin to generate in the background. You can check on the Status of your report by reading the Status column next to it, and refreshing the page periodically.\nOnce your report has generated, you can view it by either clicking on the Status (which will be set to ‘Complete: View Report’), or by opening the ⋮ menu next to your report and selecting View Report.\nStep 4: Exporting a Report Only DefectDojo users will have access to Reports stored in the software, but Reports are set up in a way where they can be exported or printed easily.\nThe easiest method to use is to Print To PDF - with an HTML Report open, open a Print dialog in your browser and set Save To PDF as the Print Destination.\nReport formatting suggestions WYSIWYG sections can be used to contextualize or summarize Finding lists. We recommend using this widget throughout your report in between Findings or Vulnerable Endpoints widgets.

The export from Wazuh can be done via 2 ways. Choose the one which you prefer.\nexport the Wazuh findings from API and upload them to DefectDojo. This method may be the easiest one but does export all known vulnerabilities at once. It is not possible to sort them after clients or any other categories. You will receive all vulnerabilities in one engagement. It also does not output the endpoint of a finding. export the findings via the script available here. The script fetches the findings by Wazuh client groups and saves them as json, ready for upload. You will receive one file per group allowing you to separate the clients via engagements in Wazuh. It also exports the endpoints hostname and displays them in DefectDojo UI.
