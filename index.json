Initially there isn't a way to categorize notes added for Findings. Admin can introduce a new attribute to notes as 'note-type' which can categorize notes. To enable note-types go to System Settings, select Note Types and add new note-types to Dojo.\n Note-type  A note-type has 4 attributes.\n Name Description is_active - This has to be true to assign the note-type to a note. is_single - If true, only one note of that note-type can exist for a Finding. is_mandatory - If true, a Finding has to have at least one note from the note-type in order to close it.    If note-types are enabled, User has to first select the note-type from the \u0026quot;Note Type\u0026quot; drop down and then add the contents of the note.\n Images  Image(s) / Screenshot(s) related to the flaw.\n  SAST specific For SAST, when source (start of the attack vector) and sink (end of the attack vector) information are available.\n Line  Source line number of the attack vector.\n Line Number  Deprecated will be removed, use line.\n File Path  Identified file(s) containing the flaw.\n SAST Source Object  Source object (variable, function...) of the attack vector.\n SAST Sink Object  Sink object (variable, function...) of the attack vector.\n SAST Source line  Source line number of the attack vector,\n SAST Source File Path  Source file path of the attack vector.\n  Images  Images  Finding images can now be uploaded to help with documentation and proof of vulnerability.\n  If you are upgrading from an older version of DefectDojo, you will have to complete the following and make sure [MEDIA_ROOT]{.title-ref} and [MEDIA_URL]{.title-ref} are properly configured:\nAdd imagekit to INSTALLED_APPS:\nINSTALLED_APPS = ( 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.sites', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'polymorphic', # provides admin templates 'overextends', 'django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.humanize', 'gunicorn', 'tastypie', 'djangobower', 'auditlog', 'dojo', 'tastypie_swagger', 'watson', 'tagging', 'custom_field', 'imagekit', )  Add [r'^media/']{.title-ref} to `LOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS`:\nLOGIN_EXEMPT_URLS = ( r'^static/', r'^api/v1/', r'^ajax/v1/', r'^reports/cover$', r'^finding/image/(?P\u0026lt;token\u0026gt;[^/]+)$' )  Then run the following commands (make sure your virtual environment is activated):\npip install django-imagekit pip install pillow --upgrade ./manage.py makemigrations dojo ./manage.py makemigrations ./manage.py migrate  New installations will already have finding images configured.\nFindings are listed on the /finding/open, /finding/closed, /finding/accepted and /finding/all pages. They can be filtered by their attributes as well as sorted by their Name, Date, Reviewed Date, Severity and Product.\n|\n|\n|\nVisual representation of a Finding:\nDeduplication / Similar findings  Automatically Flag Duplicate Findings  'De-duplication' is a feature that when enabled will compare findings to automatically identify duplicates. To enable de-duplication go to System Settings and check Deduplicate findings. Dojo deduplicates findings by comparing endpoints, CWE fields, and titles. If two findings share a URL and have the same CWE or title, Dojo marks the less recent finding as a duplicate. When deduplication is enabled, a list of deduplicated findings is added to the engagement view. The following image illustrates the option deduplication on engagement and deduplication on product level:\n  Similar Findings Visualization:\n Similar Findings  While viewing a finding, similar findings within the same product are listed along with buttons to mark one finding a duplicate of the other. Clicking the \u0026quot;Use as original\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as the original while marking the viewed finding as a duplicate. Clicking the \u0026quot;Mark as duplicate\u0026quot; button on a similar finding will mark that finding as a duplicate of the viewed finding. If a similar finding is already marked as a duplicate, then a \u0026quot;Reset duplicate status\u0026quot; button is shown instead which will remove the duplicate status on that finding along with marking it active again.\n  Metrics DefectDojo provides a number of metrics visualization in order to help with reporting, awareness and to be able to quickly communicate a products/product type's security stance.\nThe following metric views are provided:\n Product Type Metrics  This view provides graphs displaying Open Bug Count by Month, Accepted Bug Count by Month, Open Bug Count by Week, Accepted Bug Count by Week as well as tabular data on Top 10 Products by bug severity, Detail Breakdown of all reported findings, Opened Findings, Accepted Findings, Closed Findings, Trending Open Bug Count, Trending Accepted Bug Count, and Age of Issues.\n Product Type Counts  This view provides tabular data of Total Current Security Bug Count, Total Security Bugs Opened In Period, Total Security Bugs Closed In Period, Trending Total Bug Count By Month, Top 10 By Bug Severity, and Open Findings. This view works great for communication with stakeholders as it is a snapshot in time of the product.\n Simple Metrics  Provides tabular data for all Product Types. The data displayed in this view is the total number of S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, Opened This Month, and Closed This Month.\n Engineer Metrics  Provides graphs displaying information about a tester's activity.\n Metrics Dashboard  Provides a full screen, auto scroll view with many metrics in graph format. This view is great for large displays or \u0026quot;Dashboards.\u0026quot;\n  Users DefectDojo users inherit from django.contrib.auth.models.User.\nA username, first name, last name, and email address can be associated with each. Additionally the following describe the type of use they are:\n Active  Designates whether this user should be treated as active. Unselect this instead of deleting accounts.\n Staff status  Designates whether the user can log into this site.\n Superuser status  Designates that this user has all permissions without explicitly assigning them.\n  Calendar The calendar view provides a look at all the engagements occurring during the month displayed. Each entry is a direct link to the Engagement view page.\nPort Scans DefectDojo has the ability to run a port scan using nmap. Scan can be configured for TCP or UDP ports as well as for a Weekly, Monthly or Quarterly frequency.\nIn order for the scans to kick off the [dojo.management.commands.run_scan.py]{.title-ref} must run. It is easy to set up a cron job in order to kick these off at the appropriate frequency. Below is an example cron entry: :\n0 0 * * 0 /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Weekly 0 0 1 * * /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Monthly 0 0 1 3,6,9,12 * /root/.virtualenvs/dojo/bin/python /root/defect-dojo/manage.py run_scan Quarterly  The scan process will email the configured recipients with the results.\nThese scans call also be kicked off on demand by selecting the Launch Scan Now option in the view scan screen.\nNotifications DefectDojo can inform you of different events in a variety of ways. You can be notified about things like an upcoming engagement, when someone mentions you in a comment, a scheduled report has finished generating, and more.\nThe following notification methods currently exist: - Email - Slack - Microsoft Teams - Alerts within DefectDojo\nYou can set these notifications on a global scope (if you have administrator rights) or on a personal scope. For instance, an administrator might want notifications of all upcoming engagements sent to a certain Slack channel, whereas an individual user wants email notifications to be sent to the user's specified email address when a report has finished generating.\nIn order to identify and notify you about things like upcoming engagements, DefectDojo runs scheduled tasks for this purpose. These tasks are scheduled and run using Celery beat, so this needs to run for those notifications to work. Instructions on how to run Celery beat are available in the Reports section.\nBenchmarks DefectDojo utilizes the OWASP ASVS Benchmarks to benchmark a product to ensure the product meets your application technical security controls. Benchmarks can be defined per the organizations policy for secure development and multiple benchmarks can be applied to a product.\nBenchmarks are available from the Product view. To view the configured benchmarks select the dropdown menu from the right hand drop down menu. You will find the selection near the bottom of the menu entitled: 'OWASP ASVS v.3.1'.\nIn the Benchmarks view for each product, the default level is ASVS Level\n On the top right hand side the drop down can be changed to the desired ASVS level (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3). The publish checkbox will display the ASVS score on the product page and in the future this will be applied to reporting.  On the left hand side the ASVS score is displayed with the desired score, the % of benchmarks passed to achieve the score and the total enabled benchmarks for that AVSV level.\nAdditional benchmarks can be added/updated in the Django admin site. In a future release this will be brought out to the UI.\nReports DefectDojo's reports can be generated in AsciiDoc and PDF. AsciiDoc is recommended for reports with a large number of findings.\nThe PDF report is generated using wkhtmltopdf via Celery and sane defaults are included in the [settings.py]{.title-ref} file. This allows report generation to be asynchronous and improves the user experience.\nIf you are updating from an older version of DefectDojo, you will need to install [wkhtmltopdf]{.title-ref} on your own. Please follow the directions for your specific OS in the wkhtmltopdf documentation.\nSome operating systems are capable of installing [wkhtmltopdf]{.title-ref} from their package managers:\nTo get report email notifications, make sure you have a working email configuration in the system settings, and enable notifications for generated reports in the notification settings.\n Mac: :\nbrew install Caskroom/cask/wkhtmltopdf  Debian/Ubuntu: :\nsudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf  Fedora/Centos: :\nsudo yum install wkhtmltopdf  Version in debian/ubuntu repos has reduced functionality (because it's compiled without the wkhtmltopdf QT patches), such as adding outlines, headers, footers, TOC etc. To use these options you should install a static binary from wkhtmltopdf site.\n Additionally, DefectDojo takes advantage of python-PDFKit to interact with the [wkhtmltopdf]{.title-ref} commandline interface. It is easily installed by running: :\npip install pdfkit  It will also be necessary to add the path of [wkhtmltopdf]{.title-ref} to your [settings.py]{.title-ref} file. By default the following entry ships with DefectDojp: :\nWKHTMLTOPDF_PATH = '/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf'  However, you may have to update that entry to suit your installation.\nCelery is included with DefectDojo and needs to be kicked off in order for reports to generate/work. In development you can run the celery process like: :\ncelery -A dojo worker -l info --concurrency 3  In production it is recommended that the celery process be daemonized. Supervisor is also included with DefectDojo and can be set up by following the Celery documentation. A sample [celeryd.conf]{.title-ref} can be found at.\nCelery beat should also be running, this will enable defectDojo to perform periodic checks of things like upcoming and stale engagements as well as allowing for celery to clean up after itself and keep your task database from getting too large. In development you can run the process like: :\ncelery beat -A dojo -l info  In production it is recommended that the celery beat process also be daemonized. A sample [celerybeatd.conf]{.title-ref} can be found here.\nIf you are upgrading from an older version of DefectDojo, you will have to install Celery on your own. To do this you you can run: :\npip install celery  If you are using virtual environments make sure your environment is activated. You can also follow the installation instructions from the Celery documentation.\nReports can be generated for:\n Groups of Products Individual Products Endpoints Product Types Custom Reports  Filtering is available on all Report Generation views to aid in focusing the report for the appropriate need.\nCustom reports allow you to select specific components to be added to the report. These include:\n Cover Page Table of Contents WYSIWYG Content Findings List Endpoint List Page Breaks  The custom report workflow takes advantage of the same asynchronous process described above.\nIssue Consolidation DefectDojo allows users to automatically consolidate issues from multiple scanners to remove duplicates.\nTo enable this feature, hover over the configuration tab on the left menu and click on system settings. In system settings, click 'Deduplicate findings'. Click 'Submit' at the bottom of the page.\nWhen deduplication is enabled, Dojo will compare CWE, title, and endpoint details for all findings in a given product. If an issue is added with either the CWE or title being the same while the endpoint is also the same, Dojo marks the old issue as a duplicate.\nFalse Positive Removal DefectDojo allows users to tune out false positives by enabling False Positive History. This will track what engineers have labeled as false positive for a specific product and for a specific scanner. While enabled, when a tool reports the same issue that has been flagged as a false positive previously, it will automatically mark the finding as a false positive, helping to tune overly verbose security tools.\nDeduplication Deduplication is a process that allows DefectDojo to find out that a finding has already been imported.\nUpon saving a finding, defectDojo will look at the other findings in the product or the engagement (depending on the configuration) to find duplicates\nWhen a duplicate is found:\n The newly imported finding takes status: inactive, duplicate An \u0026quot;Original\u0026quot; link is displayed after the finding status, leading to the original finding  There are two ways to use the deduplication:\n   Deduplicate vulnerabilities in the same build/release. The vulnerabilities may be found by the same scanner (same scanner deduplication) or by different scanners (cross-scanner deduplication). : - this helps analysis and assessment of the technical debt, especially if using many different scanners; although detecting duplicates across scanners is not trivial as it requires a certain standardization.     Track unique vulnerabilities across builds/releases so that defectDojo knows when it finds a vulnerability whether it has seen it before. : - this allows you keep information attached to a given finding in a unique place: all further duplicate findings will point to the original one.  Deduplication Configuration Global configuration The deduplication can be activated in \u0026quot;System Settings\u0026quot; by ticking \u0026quot;Deduplicate findings\u0026quot;.\nAn option to delete duplicates can be found in the same menu, and the maximum number of duplicates to keep for the same finding can be configured.\nEngagement configuration When creating an engagement or later by editing the engagement, the \u0026quot;Deduplication within engagement only\u0026quot; checkbox can be ticked.\n If activated: Findings are only deduplicated within the same engagement. Findings present in different engagements cannot be duplicates Else: Findings are deduplicated across the whole product  Note that deduplication can never occur across different products.\nDeduplication algorithms The behavior of the deduplication can be configured for each parser in settings.dist.py (or settings.py after install) by configuring the [DEDUPLICATION_ALGORITHM_PER_PARSER]{.title-ref} variable.\nThe available algorithms are:\n   [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_UNIQUE\\_ID\\_FROM\\_TOOL]{.title-ref} : - the deduplication occurs based on finding.unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool which is a unique technical id existing in the source tool. Few scanners populate this field currently. If you want to use this algorithm, you may need to update the scanner code beforehand - The tools that populate the unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool field are: : - [Checkmarx Scan detailed]{.title-ref} - [SonarQube Scan detailed]{.title-ref} - Advantages: : - If your source tool has a reliable means of tracking a unique vulnerability across scans, this configuration will allow defectDojo to use this ability - Drawbacks: : - Using this algorithm will not allow cross-scanner deduplication as other tools will have a different technical id. - When the tool evolves, it may change the way the unique id is generated. In that case you won\\'t be able to recognise that findings found in previous scans are actually the same as the new findings.     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_HASH\\_CODE]{.title-ref} : - the deduplication occurs based on finding.hash\\_code. The hash\\_code itself is configurable for each scanner in parameter [HASHCODE\\_FIELDS\\_PER\\_SCANNER]{.title-ref}     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_UNIQUE\\_ID\\_FROM\\_TOOL\\_OR\\_HASH\\_CODE]{.title-ref} : - a finding is a duplicate with another if they have the same unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool OR the same hash\\_code - Allows to use both : - a technical deduplication (based on unique\\_id\\_from\\_tool) for a reliable same-parser deduplication - and a functional one (based on hash\\_code configured on CWE+severity+file\\_path for example) for cross-parser deduplication     [DEDUPE\\_ALGO\\_LEGACY]{.title-ref} : - This is algorithm that was in place before the configuration per parser was made possible, and also the default one for backward compatibility reasons. - Legacy algorithm basically deduplicates based on: : - For static scanner: \\[\\'title\\', \\'cwe\\', \\'line\\', \\'file\\_path\\', \\'description\\'\\] - For dynamic scanner: \\[\\'title\\', \\'cwe\\', \\'line\\', \\'file\\_path\\', \\'description\\', \\'endpoints\\'\\] - Note that there are some subtleties that may give unexpected results. Switch [dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication]{.title-ref} to debug in settings.py to get more info in case of trouble.  Hash_code computation configuration The hash_code computation can be configured for each parser using the parameter [HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER]{.title-ref} in settings.dist.py.\nThe parameter [HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS]{.title-ref} list the fields from finding table that were tested and are known to be working when used as a hash_code. Don't hesitate to enrich this list when required (the code is generic and allows adding new fields by configuration only)\nNote that [endpoints]{.title-ref} isn't a field from finding table but rather a meta value that will trigger a computation based on all the endpoints.\nWhe populating [HASHCODE_FIELDS_PER_SCANNER]{.title-ref}, please respect the order of declaration of the fields: use the same order as in [HASHCODE_ALLOWED_FIELDS]{.title-ref} : that will allow cross-scanner deduplication to function because the hash_code is computed as a sha-256 of concatenated values of the configured fields.\nTips:\n  It's advised to use fields that are standardized for a reliable deduplication, especially if aiming at cross-scanner deduplication. For example [title]{.title-ref} and [description]{.title-ref} tend to change when the tools evolve and don't allow cross-scanner deduplication\n  Good candidates are\n: - cwe or cve - Adding the severity will make sure the deduplication won't be to aggressive (there are several families of XSS and sql injection for example, with various severities but the same cwe). - Adding the file_path or endpoints is advised too.\n  The parameter [HASHCODE_ALLOWS_NULL_CWE]{.title-ref} will allow switching to legacy algorithm when a null cwe is found for a given finding: this is to avoid getting many duplicates when the tool fails to give a cwe while we are expecting it.\n  Debugging deduplication There is a specific logger that can be activated in order to have details about the deduplication process : switch [dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication]{.title-ref} to debug in settings.py.\nDeduplication - APIv2 parameters  [skip_duplicates]{.title-ref} : if true, duplicates are not inserted at all [close_old_findings]{.title-ref} : if true, findings that are not duplicates and that were in the previous scan of the same type (example ZAP) for the same product (or engagement in case of \u0026quot;Deduplication on engagement\u0026quot;) and that are not present in the new scan are closed (Inactive, Verified, Mitigated)  Service Level Agreement (SLA) DefectDojo allows you to maintain your security SLA and automatically remind teams whenever a SLA is about to get breached, or breaches.\nSimply indicate in the System Settings for each severity, how many days teams have to remediate a finding.\nSLA notification configuration There are 5 variables in the settings.py file that you can configure, to act on the global behavior. By default, any findings across the instance that are in Active, Verified state will be considered for notifications.\nSLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE = False SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE_VERIFIED_ONLY = True SLA_NOTIFY_WITH_JIRA_ONLY = False SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH = 3 SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH = 7 Setting both SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE and SLA_NOTIFY_ACTIVE_VERIFIED_ONLY to False will effectively disable SLA notifications.\nYou can choose to only consider findings that have a JIRA issue linked to them. If so, please set SLA_NOTIFY_WITH_JIRA_ONLY to True.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_PRE_BREACH is expressed in days. Whenever a finding's \u0026quot;SLA countdown\u0026quot; (time to remediate) drops to this number, a notification would be sent everyday, as scheduled by the crontab in settings.py, until the day it breaches.\nThe SLA_NOTIFY_POST_BREACH lets you define in days how long you want to be kept notified about findings that have breached the SLA. Passed that number, notifications will cease.\nBe mindful of performance if you choose to have SLA notifications on non-verified findings, especially if you import a lot of findings through CI in 'active' state.\n What notification channels for SLA notifications? The same as usual. You will notice that an extra [SLA breach]{.title-ref} option is now present on the Notification page and also in the Product view.\nSLA notification with JIRA You can choose to also send SLA notification as JIRA comments, if your product is configured with JIRA. You can enable it at the JIRA configuration level or at the Product level.\nThe Product level JIRA notification configuration takes precendence over the global JIRA notification configuration.\nWhen is the SLA notification job run? The default setup will trigger the SLA notification code at 7:30am on a daily basis, as defined in the settings.py file. You can of course modify this schedule to your context.\n'compute-sla-age-and-notify': { 'task': 'dojo.tasks.async_sla_compute_and_notify', 'schedule': crontab(hour=7, minute=30), }  The celery containers are the ones concerned with this configuration. If you suspect things are not working as expected, make sure they have the latest version of your settings.py file.\n You can of course change this default by modifying that stanza.\nLaunching from the CLI You can also invoke the SLA notification function from the CLI. For example, if run from docker-compose:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi /bin/bash -c 'python manage.py sla_notifications' "},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/basics/workflows/","title":"Workflows","tags":[],"description":"","content":"=\nExample 1 - Bill the security engineer Bill wants a place to keep track of what he's worked on, so that he can show his boss exactly what issues he reports, and statistics about how long it takes to close them.\nWhen he is asked to audit an application, Bill registers a new Product in DefectDojo, and creates a new Engagement. Here he sets some basic information, like how long he expects the Engagement will take, who will be leading the testing (himself), what Product he will be working on, and what tests he will be doing.\nNext, he can add a Test to the Engagement, or upload a Nessus scan and start picking out the real vulnerabilities from the false positives (Nessus scan Findings are imported as inactive by default).\nWithin the Test section, Bill can add Findings for any issues that he has uncovered during his audit. He can assign a severity to the Findings, describe replication steps, mitigation strategies, and impact on the system. This will come in handy when he wants to generate a report to send to the development team responsible for this Product, or his manager.\nOnce Bill has completed his Engagement, he can close the Engagement on the main Engagement page. He can then view the results of his Tests, and generate a report to send to the development team.\nIf Bill hears back from the development team that they won't be able to fix the issue for a while, he can make a note of this on the Engagement page. Bill will also receive Alerts for any bugs that persist longer than they are supposed to based on their severity.\nExample 2 - John the QE manager John wants to keep tabs on what his team members are up to, and find issues that are taking a long time to get fixed. He creates his own DefectDojo account with superuser privileges so that he can view other team members' metrics.\nTo get a better idea of what his team members are currently working on, he can start by checking the Calendar. This will show him any active Engagements that his team is involved in, based on the dates assigned to those Engagements.\nHe can view metrics for a Product Type, such as \u0026quot;Third Party Apps\u0026quot; to track his team's activity and follow up with Product teams who have long-lived bugs. He can also look at all the Findings for which there is a Risk Acceptance associated, and ensure that the proper documentation or timeline has been provided for the Findings in question.\nIf he wants to check on a particular team member's progress, he can look at the Engineer Metrics dashboard under \u0026quot;Additional Metrics\u0026quot; for that user.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/running/","title":"Running DefectDojo","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Running DefectDojo Running DefectDojo.\n Getting Started     Configuration     Running in Production     Upgrading     "},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/","title":"Contributing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Contributing  Branching Model     Documentation     How to write a DefectDojo parser     "},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/branching-model/","title":"Branching Model","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The DefectDojo team aims to release at least once a month, on the last Tuesday.

DefectDojo is a security tool that automates application security vulnerability management. DefectDojo streamlines the application security testing process by offering features such as importing third party security findings, merging and de-duping, integration with Jira, templating, report generation and security metrics.\nWhat does DefectDojo do? While traceability and metrics are the ultimate end goal, DefectDojo is a bug tracker at its core. Taking advantage of DefectDojo's Product:Engagement model, enables traceability among multiple projects and test cycles, and allows for fine-grained reporting.\nHow does DefectDojo work? DefectDojo is based on a model that allows the ultimate flexibility in your test tracking needs.\n Working in DefectDojo starts with a Product Type. Each Product Type can have one or more Products. Each Product can have one or more Engagements. Each Engagement can have one or more Tests. Each Test can have one or more Findings.  The code is open source, and available on github and a running example is available on the demo server using the credentials admin / defectdojo@demo#appsec.

Checkout dev and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re up to date with the latest changes. It\u0026rsquo;s advised that you create a dedicated branch for your development, such as git checkout -b parser-name yet that\u0026rsquo;s up to you.  It is probably easier to use the docker-compose stack (and benefit from the hot-reload capbility for uWSGI). Set up your environment to use the dev or ptvsd environment, such as:\n$ docker/setEnv.sh dev or $ docker/setEnv.sh ptvsd (allows to set breakpoints in uWSGI)\nPlease have a look at DOCKER.md for more details.\ndocker images You\u0026rsquo;d want to build your docker images locally, and eventually pass in your local user\u0026rsquo;s uid to be able to write to the image (handy for database migration files). Assuming your user\u0026rsquo;s uid is 1000, then:\n$ docker-compose build --build-arg uid=1000\nWhich files do you need to modify?    File Purpose     dojo/fixtures/test_type.json Django fixture for the type of scan. Take the next available integer if you intend to push upstream.

This is where you write your actual parser   dojo/unittests/scans/\u0026lt;parser_dir\u0026gt;/{many_vulns,no_vuln,one_vuln}.json Sample files containing meaningful data for unit tests. The minimal set.   dojo/unittests/test_\u0026lt;parser_dir\u0026gt;_parser.py The unittest class, holding unit tests definitions   dojo/tools/factory.py Import there your new parser class and add it to the long list of register_parser statement    Things to pay attention to Parsers may have many fields, out of which many of them may be optional.\nAlways make sure you include checks to avoid potential KeyError errors (e.g. field does not exist), for those fields you are not absolutely certain will always be in file that will get uploaded. These translate to 500 error, and do not look good.\nUnit tests Each parser must have unit tests, at least to test for 0 vuln, 1 vuln and many vulns. You can take a look at how other parsers have them for starters. The more quality tests, the better.\nTest database To test your unit tests locally, you first need to grant some rights. Get your MySQL root password from the docker-compose logs, login as root and issue the following commands:\nMYSQL\u0026gt; grant all privileges on test_defectdojo.* to defectdojo@'%'; MYSQL\u0026gt; flush privileges; Run your tests This local command will launch the unit test for your new parser\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests.\u0026lt;your_unittest_py_file\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;main_class_name\u0026gt; -v2'\nExample for the blackduck hub parser:\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests.test_blackduck_csv_parser.TestBlackduckHubParser -v2'\nIf you want to run all unit tests, simply run $ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py test dojo.unittests -v2'\n Other files that could be involved Change to the model In the event where you\u0026rsquo;d have to change the model, e.g. to increase a database column size to accomodate a longer string of data to be saved\n  Change what you need in dojo/models.py\n  Create a new migration file in dojo/db_migrations by running and including as part of your PR\n$ docker-compose exec uwsgi bash -c 'python manage.py makemigrations -v2'\n  Accept a different type of file to upload If you want to be able to accept a new type of file for your parser, take a look at dojo/forms.py around line 436 (at the time of this writing) or locate the 2 places (for import and re-import) where you find the string attrs={\u0026quot;accept\u0026quot;:.\nFormats currently accepted: .xml, .csv, .nessus, .json, .html, .js, .zip.\nA need for more than just the parser.py Of course, nothing prevents you from having more files than the parser.py file.

Tweak your docker-compose configuration to that effect. If you don't, you cannot pretend to be running in production.\nInstance size Please read the paragraphs below about key processes tweaks.\n Having taken the database to run elsewhere, the minimum recommendation is:\n 2 vCPUs 8 GB of RAM 2 GB of disk space (remember, your database is not here -- so basically, what you have for your O/S should do). You could allocate a different disk than your OS's for potential performance improvements.  Key processes Per https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/pull/2813, it is now easy to somewhat improve the uWSGI and celery worker performance.\nuWSGI By default (except in ptvsd mode for debug purposes), uWSGI will handle 4 concurrent connections.\nBased on your resource settings, you can tweak:\n DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_PROCESSES for the number of spawned processes. (default 2) DD_UWSGI_NUM_OF_THREADS for the number of threads in these processes. (default 2)  For example, you may have 4 processes with 6 threads each, yielding 24 concurrent connections.\nCelery worker By default, a single mono-process celery worker is spawned. This is fine until you start having many findings, and when async operations like deduplication start to kick in. Eventually, it will starve your resources and crawl to a halt, while operations continue to queue up.\nThe following variables will help a lot, while keeping a single celery worker container.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_POOL_TYPE will let you switch to prefork. (default solo)  As you've enabled [prefork]{.title-ref}, the following variables have to be used. The default are working fairly well, see the Dockerfile.django for in-file references.\n DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MIN defaults to 2. DD_CELERY_WORKER_AUTOSCALE_MAX defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY defaults to 8. DD_CELERY_WORKER_PREFETCH_MULTIPLIER defaults to 128.

Google New to DefectDojo, a Google account can now be used for Authentication, Authorization, and a DefectDojo user. Upon login with a Google account, a new user will be created if one does not already exist. The criteria for determining whether a user exists is based on the users username. In the event a new user is created, the username is that of the Google address without the domain. Once created, the user creation process will not happen again as the user is recalled by its username, and logged in. In order to make the magic happen, a Google authentication server needs to be created. Closely follow the steps below to guarantee success.\n Navigate to the following address and either create a new account, or login with an existing one: Google Developers Console Once logged in, find the key shaped button labeled Credentials on the left side of the screen.

Once the user signs in, it will try to match the UPN of the user to an existing e-mail from a user in Defect Dojo, and if no match is found, a new user will be created in Defect Dojo, associated with the unique id/value of the user provided by your Azure AD tenant. Then, you can assign roles to this user, such as \u0026lsquo;staff\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;superuser\u0026rsquo;\n Navigate to the following address and follow instructions to create a new app registration    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app   Once you register an app, take note of the following information:    Application (client) ID Directory (tenant) ID Under Certificates \u0026amp; Secrets, create a new Client Secret   Under Authentication \u0026gt; Redirect URIs, add a WEB type of uri where the redirect points to    http://localhost:8080/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/ OR https://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/azuread-tenant-oauth2/   Now, edit the dojo/settings.py file and edit/replace the following information:    DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_KEY=(str, 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_SECRET=(str, 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE''), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_TENANT_ID=(str, 'YOUR_DIRECTORY_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE''), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_AZUREAD_TENANT_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True   Restart your Dojo, and you should now see a Login with Azure AD button on the login page which should magically work  Gitlab OAuth2 Configuration In a similar fashion to that of Google and OKTA, using Gitlab as a OAuth2 provider carries the same attributes and a similar procedure. Follow along below.\n Navigate to your Gitlab settings page and got to the Applications section    https://gitlab.com/profile/applications OR https://the_hostname_you_have_gitlab_deployed:your_gitlab_port/profile/applications   Choose a name for your application For the Redirect URI, enter the DefectDojo URL with the following format    https://the_hostname_you_have_dojo_deployed:your_server_port/complete/gitlab/   Now, edit the dojo/settings.py file and edit/replace the following information:    DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_KEY=(str, 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_SECRET=(str, 'YOUR_SECRET_FROM_STEP_ABOVE'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_API_URL=(str, 'https://gitlab.com'), DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_OAUTH2_ENABLED = True  Additionally, if you want to import your Gitlab projects as DefectDojo products, add the following line, still in dojo/settings.py:\n DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_PROJECT_AUTO_IMPORT = True   Restart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with Gitlab button on the login page.  SAML 2.0 WARNING: The SAML integration below is based on https://github.com/fangli/django-saml2-auth which is no longer maintained, see #3890\nIn a similar direction OAuth, this SAML addition provides a more secure perogative to SSO. For definitions of terms used and more information, see the plugin plugin homepage\n Navigate to your SAML IdP and find your metadata Edit the dojo/settings.py file:    DD_SAML2_ENABLED=(bool, True), If the metadata can be accessed from a url, try the DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL DD_SAML2_METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL=(str, 'https://your_IdP.com/metadata.xml'), Otherwise, downlaod a copy of the metadata into an xml file, and list the path in DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH DD_SAML2_METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH=(str, '/path/to/your/metadata.xml'), Fill in DD_SAML2_ASSERTION_URL and DD_SAML2_ENTITY_ID to match the specs of you IdP. Configure the remaining optional fields to your desire.   In the \u0026quot;Authentication\u0026quot; section of the settings.py, do the following    Find the \u0026quot;SAML_2_AUTH\u0026quot; dictionary Comment out the metadata collection method that was not used. For example, if METADATA_AUTO_CONF_URL was used, comment the METADATA_LOCAL_FILE_PATH line.   Restart DefectDojo, and you should now see a Login with SAML button on the login page.  NOTE: In the case when IDP is configured to use self signed certificate, than CA needs to be specified by define environments variable REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE that points to the path of public CA certificate.\nUser Permissions  When a new user is created via the social-auth, the default permissions are only active. This means that the newly created user does not have access to add, edit, nor delete anything within DefectDojo. To circumvent that, a custom pipeline was added (dojo/pipline.py/modify_permissions) to elevate new users to staff. This can be disabled by setting \u0026lsquo;is_staff\u0026rsquo; equal to False. Similarly, for an admin account, simply add the following to the modify_permissions pipeline:  is_superuser = True\n  Exception for Gitlab OAuth2: with DD_SOCIAL_AUTH_GITLAB_PROJECT_AUTO_IMPORT set to True in dojo/settings.py, where a new user is created via the Gitlab social-auth, he has one permission: add_engagement. It allows him to create further engagements on his products via API v1.\nOther Providers In an effort to accommodate as much generality as possible, it was decided to implement OAuth2 with the social-auth ecosystem as it has a library of compatible providers with documentation of implementation. Conveniently, each provider has an identical procedure of managing the authenticated responses and authorizing access within a given application. The only difficulty is creating a new authentication client with a given OAuth2 provider.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/integrations/slack-notifications/","title":"Slack Notifications","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Scopes The following scopes have to be granted.\nToken The bot token has to be chosen and put in your System Settings\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/running/upgrading/","title":"Upgrading","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Docker-compose When you deploy a vanilla docker-compose, it will create a persistent volume for your MySQL database.

The bitnami postgresql chart required us to add a new key to the postgresql secret, which will give you the error postgresql-postgres-password is missing if you have createPostgresqlSecret: false. In 1.10.1, a fix was also included to allow your existing postgresqlPassword to be reused properly.\nIncluding in 1.10.1 were a couple fixes related to a rabbitMQ upgrade. The path to access password, erlangCookie and existingPasswordSecret changed from rabbitmq to auth. Furthermore, as rabbitMQ is deployed as a StatefulSet, an in-place upgrade is not possible and an error will likely be thrown such as Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', and 'updateStrategy' are forbidden. After ensuring your rabbitMQ celery queue is empty, you will then want to delete your rabbitMQ StatefulSet and PVC to allow them to get re-created, or fully delete and recreate defectdojo.\nUpgrading to DefectDojo Version 1.9.3 This is a security release\n See the security advisory See release notes  What's New:\n See release notes: https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/releases  NOTE:\nWhen upgrading from before 1.9.2, a corrective script may need to be ran\n[./manage.py create_endpoint_status]{.title-ref}\nIf you're using docker:\n[docker-compose exec uwsgi ./manage.py create_endpoint_status]{.title-ref}\nThis can take a while depending on your hardware and the number of findings in your instance.\n Search index tweaking index rebuild after upgrade:  This requires a (one-time) rebuild of the Django-Watson search index.

The models{.interpreted-text role=\u0026ldquo;doc\u0026rdquo;} page will help you understand the terminology we use below, so we recommend taking a look at that first.\nCreate a new Product Type The first step to using DefectDojo is to create a Product Type. Some examples might be \u0026quot;Mobile Apps\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;New York Office.\u0026quot; The idea is to make it easy to divide your Products into logical categories, based on your organizational structure, or just to divide internal and external applications.\nSelect \u0026quot;View Product Types\u0026quot; from the \u0026quot;Products\u0026quot; dropdown in the main menu.\nClick the \u0026quot;New Product Type\u0026quot; button at the top.\nEnter a name for your new Product Type.\nCreate a new Test Type {#Create a new Test Type} Test Types will help you differentiate the scope of your work. For instance, you might have a Performance Test Type, or a specific type of security testing that you regularly perform.\nSelect \u0026quot;Test Types\u0026quot; from the \u0026quot;Engagements\u0026quot; dropdown in the main menu.\nClick the \u0026quot;New Test Type\u0026quot; button at the top.\nEnter a name for your new Test Type.\nCreate a new Development Environment {#Create a new Development Environment} Development Environments are for tracking distinct deployments of a particular Product. You might have one called \u0026quot;Local\u0026quot; if you deploy the Product on your own computer for testing, or \u0026quot;Staging\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Production\u0026quot; for official deployments.\nSelect \u0026quot;Development Environments\u0026quot; from the \u0026quot;Engagements\u0026quot; dropdown in the main menu.\nClick the \u0026quot;New Development Environment\u0026quot; button at the top.\nEnter a name for your new Development Environment.\nCreate a new Engagement {#Create a new Engagement} Engagements are useful for tracking the time spent testing a Product. They are associated with a Product, a Testing Lead, and are comprised of one or more Tests that may have Findings associated with them. Engagements also show up on your calendar.\nSelect \u0026quot;Engagements\u0026quot; from the \u0026quot;Engagements\u0026quot; dropdown in the main menu.\nClick the \u0026quot;New Engagement\u0026quot; button on the right.\nEnter the details of your Engagement.\nThe [Deduplication Level]{.title-ref} specifies weather to perform deduplication only for tests in the engagement or to perform deduplication on all tests in the product which have an engagement also on [Deduplication Level]{.title-ref} product. Enabled deduplication is mandatory.\nAdding Tests to an Engagement {#Adding Tests to an Engagement} From the Engagement creation page, you can add a new Test to the Engagement. You can also add a Test to the Engagement later from that Engagement's main page. Tests are associated with a particular Test Type, a time, and an Environment.\nEnter the details of your Test.\nAdding Findings to a Test {#Adding Findings to a Test} Findings are the defects or interesting things that you want to keep track of when testing a Product during a Test/Engagement. Here, you can lay out the details of what went wrong, where you found it, what the impact is, and your proposed steps for mitigation. You can also reference CWEs, or add links to your own references.\nTemplating findings allows you to create a version of a finding that you can then re-use over and over again, on any Engagement.\nEnter the details of your Finding, or click the \u0026quot;Add Finding from Template\u0026quot; button to use a templated Finding.\nFrom the \u0026quot;Add Finding Template\u0026quot; popup, you can select finding templates from the list, or use the search bar. Templates can be used across all Engagements.\nDefine what kind of Finding this is. Is it a false positive? A duplicate? If you want to save this finding as a template, check the \u0026quot;Is template\u0026quot; box.\nAccepting a Finding Risk {#Accepting a Finding Risk} Findings cannot always be remediated or addressed for various reasons. A finding status can change to accepted by doing the following. Findings are accepted in the engagement view. To locate the engagement from the finding click the link to engagement as shown below.\n{width=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo;}\nThen, in the engagement view click the plus icon in the 'Risk Acceptance' box and fill in the details to support the risk acceptance.\n{width=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo;}\nThe engagement view is now updated with the risk.\n{width=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo;}\nThe finding status changes to 'Accepted' with a link to the risk acceptance.\n{width=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo;}\nViewing an Engagement {#Viewing an Engagement} Most of the work of an Engagement can be done from that Engagement's main page. You can view the Test Strategy or Threat Model, modify the Engagement dates, view Tests and Findings, add Risk Acceptance, complete the security Check List, or close the Engagement.\nThis page lets you do most of the common tasks that are associated with an Engagement.\nTracking your Engagements in the calendar {#Tracking your Engagements in the calendar} The calendar can help you keep track of what Engagements your team is currently working on, or determine the time line for past Engagements.\nSelect \u0026quot;Calendar\u0026quot; in the main menu.\nHere you can view the current engagements for the month, or go back in time.\nTracking metrics for your Products {#Tracking metrics for your Products} Tracking metrics for your Products can help you identify Products that may need additional help, or highlight a particularly effective member of your team.\nYou can also see the Dashboard view, a page that scrolls automatically, showing off the results of your testing. This can be useful if you want to display your team's work in public without showing specific details.\nSelect \u0026quot;All\u0026quot; or a Product Type from the \u0026quot;Metrics\u0026quot; drop-down in the main menu.\nHere you can see graphs of various metrics, with the ability to filter your results by time, Product Type, and severity.\nAt the bottom of the Metrics page, you can see granular data about your work, such as a breakdown of the most severe bugs by Product, lists of open, accepted, and closed Findings, and trends for each week, as well as the age of all current open Findings.\n"},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://DefectDojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
