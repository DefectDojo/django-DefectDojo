We recommend checking out the
[Core Data Classes](https://defectdojo.github.io/usage/models/) document to
learn the terminology of DefectDojo and the
[getting started guide](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/getting_started/)
for setting up a new installation.
We've also created some example
[workflows](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/usage/workflows/) that
should give you an idea of how to use DefectDojo for your own team.
