## Maintainer responsibilities

* Maintainers regularly attend monthly project meetings on the first Tuesday, and maintainers "office hours" on the third Tuesday of every month.
* Participate in the #defectdojo and #defectdojo-dev channels regularly.
* Reviews pull requests.
* Volunteer for and willingly accept assignments and complete them thoroughly and on time.
* Stay informed about project matters.
* Prepare themselves well for meetings.
* Build a collegial working relationship that contributes to consensus.

## Becoming a maintainer
New maintainers are selected by consensus from the current group of maintainers on an invite-only basis.

## Stop being a maintainer
Maintainership is not a necesarily a lifetime subscription. Maintainers can withdraw at any time.

Furthermore, maintainers that have not had any activities (commits, PR, PR reviews, no meeting attendance) in:
- 3 months: Current maintainers will attempt a contact.
- 6 months: If no sign of life, will be automatically removed from maintainers groups.
