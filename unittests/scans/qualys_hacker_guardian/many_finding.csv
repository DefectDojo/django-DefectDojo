A &quot;missing&quot; protection mechanism occurs when the application does not define any mechanism against a certain class of attack. An &quot;insufficient&quot; protection mechanism might provide some defenses - for example  against the most common attacks - but it does not protect against everything that is intended. Finally  an &quot;ignored&quot; mechanism occurs when a mechanism is available and in active use within the product  but the developer has not applied it in some code path.<P> Customers are advised to set proper <A HREF= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options  TARGET= _blank >X-Content-Type-Options</A> and <A HREF= https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security  TARGET= _blank >Strict-Transport-Security</A> HTTP response headers.<P> Depending on their server software  customers can set directives in their site configuration or Web.config files.
