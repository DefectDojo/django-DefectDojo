  - In the Linux kernel through 6.3.1, a use-after-free in Netfilter nf_tables when processing batch requests     can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users     can obtain root privileges. This occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled. (CVE-2023-32233)

  - MariaDB before 10.7.2 allows an application crash because it does not recognize that     SELECT_LEX::nest_level is local to each VIEW. (CVE-2021-46659)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash in find_field_in_tables and find_order_in_list via an     unused common table expression (CTE). (CVE-2021-46661)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.13 allows a ha_maria::extra application crash via certain SELECT statements.
    (CVE-2021-46663)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.2 allows an application crash because of mishandling of a pushdown from a HAVING     clause to a WHERE clause. (CVE-2021-46666)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.5 has a sql_lex.cc integer overflow, leading to an application crash. (CVE-2021-46667)

  - get_sort_by_table in MariaDB before 10.6.2 allows an application crash via certain subquery uses of ORDER     BY. (CVE-2021-46657)

  - MariaDB before 10.7.2 allows an application crash because it does not recognize that     SELECT_LEX::nest_level is local to each VIEW. (CVE-2021-46659)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash in find_field_in_tables and find_order_in_list via an     unused common table expression (CTE). (CVE-2021-46661)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.13 allows a ha_maria::extra application crash via certain SELECT statements.
    (CVE-2021-46663)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.2 allows an application crash because of mishandling of a pushdown from a HAVING     clause to a WHERE clause. (CVE-2021-46666)

  - MariaDB before 10.6.5 has a sql_lex.cc integer overflow, leading to an application crash. (CVE-2021-46667)

  - MariaDB through 10.5.9 allows an application crash via certain long SELECT DISTINCT statements that     improperly interact with storage-engine resource limitations for temporary data structures.
    (CVE-2021-46668)

  - An issue in the component my_decimal::operator= of MariaDB Server v10.6.3 and below was discovered to     allow attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via specially crafted SQL statements. (CVE-2022-27380)

  - An issue in the component Item_subselect::init_expr_cache_tracker of MariaDB Server v10.6 and below was     discovered to allow attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via specially crafted SQL statements.
    (CVE-2022-27384)

  - MariaDB Server before 10.7 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. While executing the     plugin/server_audit/server_audit.c method log_statement_ex, the held lock lock_bigbuffer is not released     correctly, which allows local users to trigger a denial of service due to the deadlock.
