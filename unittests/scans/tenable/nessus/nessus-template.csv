 strength encryption. Nessus regards medium strength as any encryption
 that uses key lengths at least 64 bits and less than 112 bits, or
 else that uses the 3DES encryption suite.

 Note that it is considerably easier to circumvent medium strength
 encryption if the attacker is on the same physical network.","Reconfigure the affected application if possible to avoid use of
 medium strength ciphers.","http://www.nessus.org/u?df5555f5

 vulnerabilities as referenced in the Version 8.2.20 advisory.

  - In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, when using Apache and PHP-
  CGI on Windows, if the system is set up to use certain code pages, Windows may use Best-Fit behavior to
  replace characters in command line given to Win32 API functions. PHP CGI module may misinterpret those
  characters as PHP options, which may allow a malicious user to pass options to PHP binary being run, and
  thus reveal the source code of scripts, run arbitrary PHP code on the server, etc. (CVE-2024-4577)

  - In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, due to a code logic error,
  filtering functions such as filter_var when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) for certain types of
  URLs the function will result in invalid user information (username + password part of URLs) being treated
  as valid user information. This may lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and
  parsing them incorrectly. (CVE-2024-5458)

  - In PHP versions 8.1.* before 8.1.29, 8.2.* before 8.2.20, 8.3.* before 8.3.8, the fix for CVE-2024-1874
  does not work if the command name includes trailing spaces. Original issue: when using proc_open() command
  with array syntax, due to insufficient escaping, if the arguments of the executed command are controlled
  by a malicious user, the user can supply arguments that would execute arbitrary commands in Windows shell.
