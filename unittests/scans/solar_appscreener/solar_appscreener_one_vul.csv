Hardcoded password,PHP,"Hardcoded password can lead to the application data being compromised. Eliminating the security risks related to the password specified in the source code is extremely difficult. These passwords are at least accessible to every developer of the application. Moreover, after the application is installed, removing from the password from its code is possible by updating only. Constant strings are easily extracted from the compiled application by decompilers. Therefore, an attacker does not necessarily need to have an access to the source code to know the parameters of the special account. If these parameters become known to an attacker, system administrators will be forced either to neglect the safety or to restrict the access to the application.","Do not store passwords in plaintext. Instead, store the values of cryptographically secure hash function obtained from the password. Use specialized hash functions designed for this purpose (bcrypt, PBKDF2, scrypt). Use salt obtained from cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator to resist rainbow table attacks. If the password specified in the source code is used for the initial authorization, provide the special authentication mode for this purpose, such that the user is required to provide his/her own unique password. Store authentication information in an encrypted form in a separate configuration file or database. Provide sufficient protection for the encryption key. If encryption is not possible, restrict an access to the repository as much as possible.","https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Use_of_hard-coded_password,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html,https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10_-_2013.pdf,https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Top_10_-_2013.pdf,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12937641/handling-passwords-used-for-auth-in-source-code,https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/how-to-securely-hash-passwords,https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication,https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1028.html,https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1032.html",misc/shared.php,151,Critical,Not processed,-,,-,-,-,-,-,-
