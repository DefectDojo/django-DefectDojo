This is particularly true\nfor applications that are distributed or that are open-source.</p>\n<p>In the past, it has led to the following vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href=\"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13466\">CVE-2019-13466</a> </li>\n  <li> <a href=\"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15389\">CVE-2018-15389</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a configuration file, a database, or a management service for secrets. </p>\n<p>This rule flags instances of hard-coded credentials used in database and LDAP connections. It looks for hard-coded credentials in connection\nstrings, and for variable names that match any of the patterns from the provided list.</p>\n<p>It's recommended to customize the configuration of this rule with additional credential words such as \"oauthToken\", \"secret\", ...</p>\n",
