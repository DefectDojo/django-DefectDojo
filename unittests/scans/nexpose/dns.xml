                        This DNS server is susceptible to DNS cache snooping, whereby an attacker
                        can make non-recursive queries to a DNS server, looking for records
                        potentially already resolved by this DNS server for other clients.
                        Depending on the response, an attacker can use this information to
                        potentially launch other attacks.

                    <Paragraph>
                        A Domain Name Server (DNS) amplification attack is a popular form of
                        distributed denial of service (DDoS) that relies on the use of publically
                        accessible open DNS servers to overwhelm a victim system with DNS response
                        traffic.
                    </Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>
                        A Domain Name Server (DNS) Amplification attack is a popular form of
                        Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), in which attackers use publically
                        accessible open DNS servers to flood a target system with DNS response traffic.
                        The primary technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS name lookup request
                        to an open DNS server with the source address spoofed to be the target's
                        address. When the DNS server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead
                        to the target. Attackers will typically submit a request for as much zone
                        information as possible to maximize the amplification effect. In most attacks
                        of this type observed by US-CERT, the spoofed queries sent by the attacker are
                        of the type, "ANY" which returns all known information about a DNS zone in a
                        single request. Because the size of the response is considerably larger than
                        the request, the attacker is able to increase the amount of traffic directed at
                        the victim. By leveraging a botnet to produce a large number of spoofed DNS
                        queries, an attacker can create an immense amount of traffic with little
                        effort. Additionally, because the responses are legitimate data coming from
                        valid servers, it is extremely difficult to prevent these types of attacks.
                        While the attacks are difficult to stop, network operators can apply several
                        possible mitigation strategies.
                    </Paragraph>

                    <Paragraph>
                        While the most common form of this attack that US-CERT has observed
                        involves DNS servers configured to allow unrestricted recursive resolution for
                        any client on the Internet, attacks can also involve authoritative name servers
                        that do not provide recursive resolution. The attack method is similar to open
                        recursive resolvers, but is more difficult to mitigate since even a server
                        configured with best practices can still be used in an attack. In the case of
                        authoritative servers, mitigation should focus on using Response Rate Limiting
                        to restrict the amount of traffic.
