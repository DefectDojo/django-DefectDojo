2023-01-25T00:19:27Z,AKS role/cluster role assigned permissions that contain wildcards ,INFORMATIONAL,OPEN,"#### Description
This role is assigned an over-permissive policy that contains wildcards (""*"").

#### Potential impact
This role is essentially assigned administrative permissions, probably unnecessarily. An attacker that gains access to the principal the policy is attached to is able to perform any action on any resource in the environment.

* Use the “least privilege” principle when assigning permissions, meaning that each account is assigned the exact permissions that it needs to function properly. When assigning permissions, avoid wild-card permissions.
* To find unused permissions assigned to the principal, use the “Excessive Permissions” object on the Security Graph.
* Minimize the attack surface of principals with sensitive permissions by remediating all Issues associated to them.
* Avoid using access keys. They function as long-term credentials to the principal, and are more easily compromised.
* Enable MFA for users with sensitive permissions if possible.",Wiz - Demo-Scenarios,https://demo.wiz.io/issues#~(issue~'0029ee49-c676-432f-8690-12f2862ec708),,{},,,
