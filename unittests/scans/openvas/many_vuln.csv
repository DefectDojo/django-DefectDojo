  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the
  Timestamp options when initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer
  that is initiating communication includes them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
