  Starting with Windows Server 2008 and Vista, the timestamp can not be completely disabled.

  The default behavior of the TCP/IP stack on this Systems is to not use the Timestamp options when
  initiating TCP connections, but use them if the TCP peer that is initiating communication includes
  them in their synchronize (SYN) segment.
