<Value>Consider whether the application requires the requested permission in order to function properly. If it does not, you should remove the permission from the AndroidManifest.xml file. Do no over-permission the application by requesting more permissions than it really needs. This can lead to other malicious applications installed on the device taking advantage of such over-permissioned applications to adversely impact the user experience and the stored data. Additionally, extra permissions may unnecessarily discourage customers from installing your application.</Value>

<Value>The method redacted() in redacted.java can crash the program by dereferencing a null pointer on line 28.</Value>

<Name>Explanation</Name>
<Value>Null pointer exceptions usually occur when one or more of the programmer's assumptions is violated. A dereference-after-store error occurs when a program explicitly sets an object to null and dereferences it later. This error is often the result of a programmer initializing a variable to null when it is declared.


Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if attackers can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, they can use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.

Example: In the following code, the programmer explicitly sets the variable foo to null. Later, the programmer dereferences foo before checking the object for a null value.


Foo foo = null;
...
foo.setBar(val);
...
}
</Value>
                            </MetaInfo>
                            <MetaInfo>
<Name>Recommendations</Name>
<Value>Implement careful checks before dereferencing objects that might be null. When possible, abstract null checks into wrappers around code that manipulates resources to ensure that they are applied in all cases and to minimize the places where mistakes can occur.</Value>

CWE provides a unified, measurable set of software weaknesses that is enabling more effective discussion, description, selection, and use of software security tools and services that can find these weaknesses in source code and operational systems as well as better understanding and management of software weaknesses related to architecture and design.

Name: 		DISA CCI 2
ID: 				7F037130-41E5-40F0-B653-7819A4B3E241
The purpose of a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Control Correlation Identifier (CCI) is to provide a standard identifier for policy based requirements which connect high-level policy expressions and low-level technical implementations. Associated with each CCI is a description for each of the singular, actionable, statements compromising an information assurance (IA) control or IA best practice. Using CCI allows high-level policy framework security requirements to be decomposed and explicitly associated with low-level implementations, thus enabling the assessment of related compliance assessment results spanning heterogeneous technologies. The current IA controls and best practices associated with each CCI, that are specified in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4, can be viewed using the DISA STIG Viewer.  
The following table summarizes the number of issues identified across the different CCIs broken down by Fortify Priority Order. The status of a CCI is considered "In Place" when there are no issues reported for a given CCI.  

If the project is missing a Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) scan, or the scan contains findings that have not been fixed, hidden or suppressed, CCI-003187 is not considered "In Place". Similarly, if the project is missing a Micro Focus Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, CCI-000366 and CCI-000256 are not considered "In Place".

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. Going into effect on May 25, 2018, GDPR provides a framework for organizations on how to handle personal data.        According to GDPR regulation personal data "means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."      GDPR articles that pertain to application security and require businesses to protect personal data during design and development of its product and services are:

   - Article 25, Data protection by design and by default - which requires "The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed."
   - Article 32, Security of processing - which requires businesses to protect its systems and applications "from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data".       This report may be used by organizations as a framework to help identify and protect personal data as it relates to application security.

Name: 		MISRA C 2012
ID: 				555A3A66-A0E1-47AF-910C-3F19A6FB2506
Now in its third edition, the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) C Guidelines describe a subset of the C programming language in which there is reduced risk of introducing mistakes in critical systems. While the MISRA C Guidelines focus upon safety-related software development, a subset of the rules also reflect security properties. Fortify interprets the MISRA C Guidelines under the context of security and provides correlation of security vulnerabilty categories to the rules defined by MISRA. Fortify provides these security focused detection mechanism with the standard rulepacks, however, further support of the MISRA C Guidelines related to safety can be added through the use of custom rules. The results in this report can assist in the creation of a compliance matrix for MISRA.

The 2009 CWE/SANS Top 25 Programming Errors list the most significant programming errors that can lead to serious software vulnerabilities. They occur frequently, are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all. The list is the result of collaboration between the SANS Institute, MITRE, and many top software security experts.

Each requirement or recommendation identified by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIG is represented by a STIG identifier (STIGID) which corresponds to a checklist item and a severity code [APP&lt;I&gt;ID&lt;/I&gt;: CAT &lt;I&gt;SEV&lt;/I&gt;]. DISA STIG defines three severities with respect to vulnerabilities where their:
    
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation leads to direct and immediate loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT I).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation potentially results in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT II).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;existence degrades protections against loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT III).&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;/UL&gt;
  
The following table summarizes the number of issues identified across the different STIGIDs broken down by Fortify Priority Order. The status of a STIGID is considered "In Place" when there are no issues reported for a given STIGID.  

If the project is missing a Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) scan, or the scan contains findings that have not been fixed, hidden or suppressed, STIGID APP5080: CAT II is not considered "In Place". Similarly, if the project is missing an Micro Focus Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, STIGID APP5100: CAT II is not considered "In Place".

If the project is missing a Fortify Static Code Analyzer (SCA) scan, or the scan contains findings that have not been fixed, hidden or suppressed, STIGID APSC-DV-003170: CAT II is not considered "In Place". Similarly, if the project is missing an Micro Focus Fortify WebInspect scan, or the scan contains any critical findings, STIGID APSC-DV-001460: CAT II and STIGID APSC-DV-002930: CAT II are not considered "In Place".

ID: 				E6805D9F-D5B5-4192-962C-46828FF68507
Each requirement or recommendation identified by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) STIG is represented by a STIG identifier (STIGID) which corresponds to a checklist item and a severity code [APSC-DV-&lt;I&gt;ID&lt;/I&gt;: CAT &lt;I&gt;SEV&lt;/I&gt;]. DISA STIG defines three severities with respect to vulnerabilities where their:
    
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation leads to direct and immediate loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT I).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;exploitation potentially results in loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT II).&lt;/LI&gt; 
&lt;LI&gt;existence degrades protections against loss of Confidentiality, Availability, or Integrity (CAT III).&lt;/LI&gt;  &lt;/UL&gt;
