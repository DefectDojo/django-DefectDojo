If remote access was enabled explicitly and some protection method (such as security constraint) wasn't set, an intruder can load own custom class and execute its code in a process with H2 Console (H2 Server process or a web server with H2 Console servlet).\n\nIt is also possible to load them by creation a linked table in these versions, but it requires `ADMIN` privileges and user with `ADMIN` privileges has full access to the Java process by design. These privileges should never be granted to untrusted users.\n\n### Patches\nSince version 2.0.206 H2 Console and linked tables explicitly forbid attempts to specify LDAP URLs for JNDI. Only local data sources can be used.\n\n### Workarounds\nH2 Console should never be available to untrusted users.\n\n`-webAllowOthers` is a dangerous setting that should be avoided.\n\nH2 Console Servlet deployed on a web server can be protected with a security constraint:\nhttps://h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#usingH2ConsoleServlet\nIf `webAllowOthers` is specified, you need to uncomment and edit `<security-role>` and `<security-constraint>` as necessary. See documentation of your web server for more details.\n\n### References\nThis issue was found and privately reported to H2 team by [JFrog Security](https://www.jfrog.com/)'s vulnerability research team with detailed information.\n","summary":"RCE in H2 Console","identifiers":[{"type":"GHSA","value":"GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6"},{"type":"CVE","value":"CVE-2021-42392"}],"cvss":{"score":9.8,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"cwes":{"nodes":[{"cweId":"CWE-502"}]},"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/h2database/h2database/security/advisories/GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6"},{"url":"https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.0.206"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392"},{"url":"https://jfrog.com/blog/the-jndi-strikes-back-unauthenticated-rce-in-h2-database-console/"},{"url":"https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220119-0001/"},{"url":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/02/msg00017.html"},{"url":"https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5076"},{"url":"https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6"}]}}}]}}}}
