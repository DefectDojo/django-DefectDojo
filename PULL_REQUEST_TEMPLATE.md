Please submit your pull requests to the 'dev' branch.

When submitting a pull request, please make sure you have completed the following checklist:

- [ ] Your code is flake8 compliant (DefectDojo's code isn't currently flake8 compliant, but we're trying to correct that.)
- [ ] If this is a new feature and not a bug fix, you've included the proper documentation in the ReadTheDocs documentation folder. https://github.com/DefectDojo/Documentation/tree/master/docs or provide feature documentation in the PR.
- [ ] Add applicable tests to the unit tests.
