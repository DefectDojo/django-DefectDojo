Please submit your pull requests to the 'dev' branch.

When submitting a pull request, please make sure you have completed the following checklist:

- [ ] Your code is flake8 compliant (Dojo's code isn't currently flake8 compliant, but we're trying to correct that)
- [ ] If this is a new feature and not a bug fix, you've included the proper documentation under the /docs folder
