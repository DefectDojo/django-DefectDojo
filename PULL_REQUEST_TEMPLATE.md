When submitting a pull request, please make sure you have completed the following checklist:

- [ ] Your code is pep8 compliant (Dojo's code isn't currently pep8 compliant, but we're trying to correct that)
- [ ] If this is a new feature and not a bug fix, you've included the proper documentation under the /docs folder
- [ ] If you have modified Dojo models, the corresponding migration files have been generated
