# Contributing to DefectDojo

Here are a few things to keep in mind when making changes to DefectDojo.

## Modifying DefectDojo and Testing

Please use [these test scripts](./tests) to test your changes. These are the exact scripts we run in our [Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/OWASP/django-DefectDojo).

For changes that require additional settings, settings.dist.py is the file you want to change. Settings.py is created by setup.bash from settings.dist.py

## Python3 version
For compatibility reasons, the code in dev branch should be python3.5 compliant.

## Logging
Logging is configured in `settings.dist.py`.

Specific logger can be added. For example to activate logs related to the deduplication, change the level from DEBUG to INFO in:

```
          'dojo.specific-loggers.deduplication': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'propagate': False,
        }
```
