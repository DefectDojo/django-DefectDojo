No technology is perfect, and OWASP DefectDojo believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly. 

# Disclosure Policy

* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party. 
* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder. 

# Exclusions 
While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from: 
* Denial of service 
* Spamming 
* Social engineering (including phishing) of DefectDojo staff or contractors 
* Any physical attempts against DefectDojo property or cloud hosted environments
