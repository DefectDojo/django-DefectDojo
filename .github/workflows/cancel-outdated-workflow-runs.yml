name: Cancel outdated workflow runs
# For each branch (i.e. PR) we're only interested in the latest commit to be tested
# this job cancels any previous workflow runs still in progress on the same branch
# freeing up spots in the queue for the most recent commits
# and saving some trees along the way

# run on pull_request_target because we need write access to the GItHub API
# don't run any code from PR here!
