        # by default the pull_requst_target event checks out the base branch, i.e. dev
        # so we need to explicitly checkout the head of the PR, which lives inside the repo of the pull request author
        # we use fetch-depth 0 to make sure the full history is checked out and we can compare against
        # the base commit (branch) of the PR
        # more info https://github.community/t/github-actions-are-severely-limited-on-prs/18179/16
        # remaining issue: this checks out the base commit of the dev branch, which can be lagging behind HEAD of dev
        # maybe we could use the 'before' and 'after' shas that are in the github event json
