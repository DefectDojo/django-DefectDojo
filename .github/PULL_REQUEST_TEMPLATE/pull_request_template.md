# Contributors: Git Tips
## Rebase on dev branch
If the dev branch has changed since you started working on it, please rebase your work after the current dev.

On your working branch `mybranch`:
```
git rebase dev mybranch
```
In case of conflict:
```
 git mergetool
 git rebase --continue
 ```

When everything's fine on your local branch, force push to your `myOrigin` remote:
```
git push myOrigin --force-with-lease
```

To cancel everything:
```
git rebase --abort
```


## Squashing commits
```
git rebase -i origin/dev
```
- Replace `pick` by `fixup` on the commits you want squashed out
- Replace `pick` by `reword` on the first commit if you want to change the commit message
- Save the file and quit your editor

Force push to your `myOrigin` remote:
```
git push myOrigin --force-with-lease
```
